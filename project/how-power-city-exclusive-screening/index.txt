18:T1612,<p>Our exclusive screening of, <strong>"<a href="https://www.powercityfilm.com/">How to Power a City</a>",</strong> a documentary directed by <strong>Melanie LaRosa</strong> is dedicated to raise awareness and foster positive change in our community toward a clean energy future. The screening will be <strong>co-hosted by</strong> <a href="http://www.soulardarity.com"><strong>Soulardarity </strong></a>and <a href="http://www.parkervillagehp.com/"><strong>Parker Village</strong></a>, both featured in the film at a one-of-a-kind green space owned and operated by Parker Village, this urban oasis is located not far from the iconic and currently abandoned Ford Plant, making it a prime location for local residents and visitors alike. The film includes our story along with Highland Park partners and residents fighting to replace 1000+ residential street lights removed by the electric monopoly DTE Energy in 2011 with community-owned solar street lights. </p>

<p>By attending the "How to Power a City" documentary screening, you will help us raise awareness, inspire action, and create a positive impact within our community. Together, let's shine a light on the issues that matter and work towards a brighter future for all.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE VENUE: </strong>Screening will be held on the grounds of Parker Village, a one-of-a-kind green space. This urban oasis is located not far from the iconic and currently abandoned Ford Plant, making it a prime location for local residents and visitors alike. Parker Village is a vibrant and diverse community hub located in Highland Park, MI, that is undergoing a transformative revitalization.</p>

<p>Parker Village has faced several challenges along the way. The neighborhood has a high number of vacant lots and abandoned buildings, which not only contribute to blight but also compromise the safety and aesthetics of the neighborhood. The streets have no other streetlights other than the solar-powered streetlights enabled with mesh wifi, installed through the partnership of Parker Village and  Soulardarity. Additionally, Parker VIllage provides access to green spaces that was once non-existent, depriving residents, particularly children and families, of opportunities for recreation and a connection with nature.</p>

<p>The Concept for Parker Village took flight in October of 2015, when the first property was purchased. The 43,000 sq ft. former Thompson Elementary School in Highland Park. 5 other properties quickly joined the portfolio, adding 10 potential new residences to the Smart Neighborhood development.  soon after we began working with world-renowned Architect, Paul Bierman-Lytle on the initial renderings for the campus and the Smart-neighborhood.  In 2018, we installed the first solar smart streetlight in the mid-west, signaling the change and rejuvenation to come.</p>

<p>In 2019, our second solar installation, a water and power shed was built.  A commissioned mural by artist, Waleed Johnson with support from Art-ops, A non-profit organization supporting the arts in the city of Highland Park, was added to the structure and unveiled to the media, the community, and city officials.</p>

<p>The Shed was built as a joint project with Soulardarity, Ryter Cooperative Industries, Appropriate ​Technology Corp, and students from the Black Caucus Foundation.   2020 saw the installation of our Solar Pergola that will power our off-grid healthy-choice cafe. This will be the first stand-alone solar cafe in the United States. Other improvements to the campus including landscaping, signage, and modification to conduct weekend marketplace events.</p>

<p><strong>Highland Park Today</strong></p>

<p>A small 2.9 sq. mile city inside of Detroit. Highland Park is nestled in the middle of Detroit, a major metropolis, yet it does not always benefit from the transportation and mobility opportunities that exist within Detroit. It is the site of the world's first automobile assembly line and urban freeway. Highland Park has a prominent history of facing environmental injustices, along with job &amp; population loss after deindustrialization, when the automotive and fossil fuel industry that built the city, relocated since then the city has experienced a meteoric drop in population, employment, and tax base that has left much of its infrastructure in disrepair.</p>

<p>Highland Park is a city that now faces disproportionate impacts from climate change, including heat wave intensity and frequency, cold freezes, energy insecurity, degraded air quality, reduced water quality, and increased public health risks. Currently over two thirds of Highland Park residents live without streetlights, a reality after 1,000 street lights were removed by DTE. because of municipal city debt The significantly smaller population from the peak has decreased tax revenue, consequently leading to failed municipal services.</p>

<p>The energy burden, insecurity, and poverty within Highland Park significantly impacts the economic and public health of residents. Residents have experienced consistent increases in residential electricity rates from the local, private utility. According to resident reports, poor energy reliance has left some households with multiple days of outages this past year during heat waves, winter storms, and pandemic conditions. Highland Park residents are prone to low wage earning employment that impacts their overall quality of life, even as it relates to energy security. The median annual household income is $18,474. This significantly impacts a family’s ability to be an active participant in the local economy. Therefore, there is much work to be done to stand up a robust workforce development strategy that is in alignment with the city’s overall economic development plans.</p>

<p>Even while being impacted by historical challenges, Highland Park is abundant with bold people-power, frontline action, and innovation. Dedicated community leaders, organizers, and entrepreneurs have been working tirelessly to lay the foundation for sustainable, equitable, and resilient solutions for Highland Park. As the nation once again faces the need for massive, unprecedented transformation of our power systems and infrastructure in response to climate change, your donations will advance resilient root solutions and advance energy justice, so that all Highland Park residents benefit. Highland Park is overflowing with clean energy work and leadership that will pilot the transformative solutions that we need scaled across our state and country.</p>
