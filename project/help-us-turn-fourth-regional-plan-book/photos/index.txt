	RPA’s once-a-generation regional plans have guided the growth of the New York – New Jersey – Connecticut metropolitan area for nearly 100 years. Ideas and recommendations made in RPA’s first three plans, published in 1929, 1968 and 1996, have led to the establishment of some of the region’s most significant infrastructure, open space and economic development projects—including new bridges and roadways, improvements to our transit network, the preservation of vital open space and the renewed emphasis on creating sustainable communities centered around jobs and transit.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	In late 2017, RPA released its Fourth Regional Plan, seeking to address the region’s most pressing issues—including housing affordability, overburdened transportation infrastructure, vulnerability to climate change, and failing governance structures. The plan was the product of five years of research and public engagement with residents, civic partners, business leaders and government officials.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	The fourth plan was released as a <a href="http://www.fourthplan.org">website</a>, but many have requested that the fourth plan also be published as a book, an enduring point of reference for students, planners, community leaders, advocates, government officials, and armchair urbanists. We are launching this campaign to help fund and distribute a print run of the fourth plan to schools, libraries, community organizations and government offices across our region, as well as to supporters like YOU!  </div>
<div>
	 </div>
18:T828,<div>
	<div>
		We started work on the Fourth Regional Plan by conducting surveys, convened focus groups and talked to a wide range of community, civic, business and public-sector leaders to better understand the needs and concerns of everyone who calls the metropolitan area home.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		<strong>What emerged was a paradox.</strong></div>
	<div>
		People in the New York City metropolitan region love where they live, and they believe in the region’s future potential. They have seen the region face daunting challenges over the past generation and come back even stronger. This was true for everyone we spoke with: rich and poor, city dweller and suburbanite, young and old, families and single people.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		<strong>But people also said they were losing faith.</strong></div>
	<div>
		Regardless of where they lived or how much money they made, many said life was becoming too expensive, housing and jobs were too difficult to find, and the social divisions in our society were too deep.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		<strong>Most distressing was the feeling that we could not solve these problems. </strong></div>
	<div>
		The fourth plan is about how we can secure a safe and prosperous future for the next generation if we break free from thinking that these problems are too big or too complex to solve. But first we must shake off our old habits and assumptions and have a bold plan of action that considers the needs of everyone in our region. The Fourth Regional Plan is a roadmap to making the region work for all of us.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		<strong>It takes a village.</strong></div>
	<div>
		The fourth plan was the product of a whole movement of effective and thoughtful leaders on community, transportation, housing, environmental and governance issues. It is these leaders and their successors who need to be empowered and motivated to make change over the next decade. Help us get the Fourth Regional Plan in their hands!</div>
