18:T6d3,<p>The Firefly Trail will be a 39-mile multi-purpose trail in Northeast Georgia, following the abandoned corridor of the Georgia Railroad Athens Branch. From the university city of Athens to the friendly towns of Maxeys and Union Point, the trail will promote safety, better health, economic development, transportation options, tourism, historic preservation -- and fun.  Linking urban, suburban and rural landscapes, the trail will be a linear park that enhances the environment and highlights our region's rich history and culture.</p>

<p>Firefly Trail, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) Georgia charity incorporated to spearhead the creation of the trail. In recent years, Firefly Trail, Inc.(FTI) has achieved key successes: 1) a successful Model Miles fundraising campaign which secured the paving of three model miles in the Athens, Maxeys and Union Point, 2) secured 2017 TSPLOST funding for paving 9 miles of the trail from Athens to Winterville, and 3) establishment of Local Action Committees (LACs) in the communities of Union Point, Maxeys, Crawford, Winterville and East Athens.  Our next goal is to secure funding to pay for 13 miles of the trail from Union Point to Maxeys - the Southern Segment.</p>

<p>We are launching the Firefly Trail Year-End Challenge campaign to maintain our dynamic infrastructure (LACs, etc.) and be competitive in applying for large grants. Unfortunately, our main 2020 fund raising events had to be cancelled due to COVID 19.  We need to replace those funds, and strengthen our presence in trail communities, so we can compete for those grants. The Firefly Trail, Inc. needs your help to keep the momentum going and BUILD THIS TRAIL!</p>

<p> Your donation is greatly needed - and appreciated!</p>
19:T787,<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Many of the towns and all of the rural areas the trail will serve have few, if any, sidewalks, bike facilities or other infrastructure for off-road exercise and active transportation. For example, to walk to their elementary school just north of Union Point, students must use the unimproved shoulder of a busy 2-lane highway. In Athens, three people have tragically lost their lives since 2014 while bicycling on roads close to the route of the Firefly Trail.</p>

<p><strong>Health: </strong>Thousands of people living near the trail corridor are unable to play and exercise safety in their own communities. As a result, most don't. Rates of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are among the highest in the nation. Studies show every $1 spent on trails yields $2.94 in direct health benefits.  Using the trail will not only be safer, it will be fun -- inspiring more people to get up and get moving. The Firefly Trail will bring opportunities and hope for longer, healthier, happier lives.</p>

<p><strong>Economic development:</strong> Many of the neighborhoods and communities served by the Firefly Trail are struggling economically. Trails create opportunities for new and existing businesses; attract new residents, entrepreneurs and tourists; boost property values, and improve quality of life. A Firefly Trail economic impact study estimates the finished trail will attract more than 1.1 million users a year and generate $14.7 million in annual economic impact. Just building the trail will generate/sustain 158 jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Attractive corridor:</strong> The corridor connects charming towns, beautiful countryside, schools, businesses, historic features and town centers. Importantly, as an abandoned railroad corridor, it provides a level route through the hills and valleys of Northeast Georgia, allowing people of all ages and abilities to enjoy using it.</p>
