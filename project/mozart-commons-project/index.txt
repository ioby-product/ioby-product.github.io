<p>For this initial round of fundraising, we aim to raise a total of $10,000, which will be spent on rebuilding the infrastructure around the stone theatre steps and applying high-quality astroturf over a new soil foundation.  Because we have a Mozart community member who owns a small business in this industry, we will be able to obtain these materials and services at cost.</p>

18:T772,<p><strong>The Mozart School's outdoor common area is more than a playground. It's a community space.</strong></p>
<p>The school's common area includes two great spaces that are in urgent need of repair and attention:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		An outdoor amphitheatre and patio</li>
	<li>
		A garden space</li>
</ul>
<p>This spring, we want to refurbish the outdoor amphitheatre as Phase One of our refurbishment effort. And we need your help!</p>
<p><b>This will benefit the entire community - not just Mozart students and staff.</b><br />
	Because of the complex lottery system in our urban district, only some of the young families that live in the Mozart neighborhood attend the school.   But - and here's the kicker - nearly all the local families utilize the playground and adjacent play yard.   Our outside space is utilized year-round by families, play groups, block parties, and more.   </p>
<p>With the funds we raise this spring, we plan to make this built-in amphitheatre more usable and create a community"commons" area that will prove itself as a third space for activities and events including:   </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Concert: the school's already robust music program would actually have a place to hold concerts and recitals (allowing it to live up to its namesake!). </li>
	<li>
		The afterschool program at the Mozart - which is run by the YMCA, and as such is entirely separate from the school administration - would have a place to perform plays and concerts (the program director has a degree in drama and would fully utilize this space).</li>
	<li>
		Everything from pop-up play workshops to community theatre performances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we need now.</strong><br />
	This project is a multi-phase effort, and the first chapter will involve the shoring up of the amphitheatre steps installation of astroturf and new soil base.   </p>
<p> </p>
19:T638,<div>
	We feel strongly that this project will not only solve an existing challenge for the Mozart Elementary school, but also provide an invaluable service and gathering space for other community groups. </div>
<p><span>For a typical grade school that might have access to an indoor theater or a gym with bleachers, an outdoor theatre area would be merely a nice-to-have feature; but for our pocket-sized school, with its incredibly meager indoor space, this outdoor performance space is a must-have.  After considerable analysis and discussion by district and school admins, the consensus is that the only way for this school to grow its community and multi-purpose space is to leverage the outdoor infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>We have been presented with a unique opportunity to solve this problem:  a member of our Mozart community is the owner of a small, local astroturf business, and is willing to provide materials and installation services at cost.   While $10k is a daunting amount of money for our little school to raise, it is actually only about 70% of what this would cost at full retail.   So the time is now to reclaim this vital commons area for our kids and neighbors!</p>
<p>If we can get the astroturf and soil scaffolding project in by summer vacation, then we can embark on the second wave of fundraising with a goal of raising the money to install shade sails over the space.  Not only would this make the space usable in a wider variety of weather, but it would better define the space and lend to the "commons" aesthetic.</p>
