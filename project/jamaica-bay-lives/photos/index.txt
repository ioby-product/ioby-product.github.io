17:T906,<p><em><strong>UPDATE (5/30/2014): Jamaica Bay Lives has<span> moved on to the next phase and we are now collaborating with New York City Audubon to finish the project. This partnership wouldn't have been possible without our ioby start-up funding. </span></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><span>To learn more about our project, head to </span><a href="http://www.jamaicabaylives.com/" target="_blank">www.jamaicabaylives.com</a> <span>and make a donation by visiting </span><a href="https://www.gifttool.com/donations/Donate?ID=1123&amp;AID=2904" target="_blank">ttps://www.gifttool.com/donati<wbr></wbr>ons/Donate?ID=1123&amp;AID=2904</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p><span>Jamaica Bay is located in the largest city in America. Nearly 500,000 people live within a ten-minute drive. Yet most New Yorkers have never even heard of Jamaica Bay. </span></p>
<p><span>Why? Because for much of its history, this was a place you’d rather forget. Starting with fish-oil and horse-rendering factories that opened on Barren Island in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Jamaica Bay has been a place to put all things unwanted. From towering landfills to sewage treatment plants, Jamaica Bay has suffered more than its share of abuses.   </span></p>
<p><span>But abuse it is only part of the bay’s story. Jamaica Bay has a rich history that has never been properly celebrated, from the legendary oysters that were once the toast of New York to the fascinating and distinct communities that line its shores.</span></p>
<p><span>Now in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the bay has reached a new inflection point. A major initiative is underway to transform the bay into a “world class” harbor estuary, but what does that mean and who gets to decide its future? </span></p>
<p><span>“Jamaica Bay Lives” will weave together the history, the people and the issues into a rich visual fabric that explores this fascinating place. This first-ever, feature-length film on the bay will convey the complexity of its problems and the lack of easy solutions. </span></p>
<p><span>This film’s ultimate goal is to elevate the public dialog about Jamaica Bay, to engage more New Yorkers in the fight for a better future and to help secure the bay’s rightful place in the pantheon of great New York City places.</span></p>
18:T7bd,<p>First of all, we have already engaged many stakeholders in the project -- people like historians, local residents, environmentalists, educators, naturalists and government officials. Bringing them together for this project has already further galvanized support for Jamaica Bay. Many are surprised that no full-length film about the bay has been done before.</p>
<p>Second, as the trailer is produced, our team will continue to film around Jamaica Bay through 2012. We have already lined up shoots with students, nonprofit groups, beach cleanups and so on. Participating in our film will validate and honor the work they are doing and encourage them to persevere.</p>
<p>By partnering with local civic and cultural organizations, we also plan to involve people in the film by asking them if they have particularly interesting oral histories or photographs and family films they can share. This is a community-driven, ground-up project that simply will not happen without strong public participation. We expect dozens of people to help us out with this aspect of the film.</p>
<p>Next, after our trailer has been completed, we intend to show it at short-film festivals throughout the region to generate excitement and momentum. This will expand knowledge about the bay and encourage more people to support both the final film and Jamaica Bay's restoration.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, we will use social media tools like Facebook and Twitter to generate excitement and keep people interested in the bay. We will also create a Web site that will feature resources to learn more. </p>
<p>Finally, once the film has been completed, we expect it to air widely on local television and earn widespread earned media coverage. We will make the film available to local public libraries and schools so they can learn more. We also expect to offer public talks with our production team that will connect the filmmakers with public to further the discussion about Jamaica Bay.</p>

Despite so many people living nearby, and the impressive work of a committed number of advocates, the biggest threat to Jamaica Bay's future is the lack of a cohesive constituency to fight for it. So many people living nearby don't know it, think it's irreparably polluted or --  worse yet -- don't even know it's there. Our documentary film will bridge that gap by educating the public about the bay and its history, engaging them in the fight for its future, and influencing decision-makers at all levels that Jamaica Bay is a place worth saving.</p>\r\n","leader_display_name":"Daniel Hendrick","name":"Jamaica Bay Lives","neighborhood":"Broad Channel, the Rockaways, Floyd Bennett Field, Canarsie, Howard Beach, Richmond Hill, South Ozone Park, Rosedale, Springfield Gardens, Jamaica","published_at":"2012-04-24T00:00:00","results_description":"$18","slug":"jamaica-bay-lives","start_date":"2012-04-01","status":"underway","steps_description":"<p>Our main focus at this stage of work is to hire a professional editor to package the film into a trailer that we can show to foundations, local PBS stations and the public.

Our producer, director, production assistant and business manager are all currently volunteering their time. For us, this is a labor of love; we have paid all of our expenses out of our own pockets.
