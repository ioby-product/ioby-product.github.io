<p>This is a community engagement project, woven into the “Microbes to Metropolis" Laboratory currently at Grace Exhibition Space on the plaza. DD is the Artist in Residence until 10-31. The lab space inside is incubating a story of community building that starts with microbes and finishes with designing the metropolis. We attract neighbors to each other out of which we design a society together.</p>

<p>"MoS MoBS LoBS" refers to the Master of Beneficial Succession. We create new connections between lifestyles of bioremediation and symbiosis. We are a laboratory for science, invention and design systems that create the beneficial succession of air, water, soil &amp; selves. Going beyond sustainable systems, these networks leave exponential betterment. </p>

<p>We continue to experiment despite COVID-19. We slow down, follow guidelines &amp; dream bigger than ever. We are more focused, passionate and determined to use public space safely outside. Combining tech with tradition, we tell our stories, share knowledge and vision with all ages.  </p>

<p>Please support us to make this windy plaza an exponential people place.</p>

<p>We will continue through the winter by turning us into a virtual plaza culture &amp; economy that is of beneficial succession: caring for ourselves, eachother &amp; the earth.  Join as a player!  Contact us here or through the website MoScollective.net</p>
18:T7a8,<p>We had been planning to do a large permaculture plan of the LES between 14/Houston since last year, with a shared community schedule of happenings (gardens, community, wellness, family friendly). Grace Exhibition Space, a performance art and permaculture venue, agreed to host us. </p>

<p>After the onset of COVID-19, Grace Exhibition Space stopped holding events inside. I was offered the space to work on deliverables for the eco pageant held May 9. After that I decided to sit in meditation making one mudball for every one of the 30,000 people who succumbed to the virus in NYC. (Mudballs are packed with natural enzymes that clean our waterways.) The EM-1 &amp; molasses were donated but no soil was available. So instead, in tribute I grew tomatoes, basil, and kale for the community with the little soil I found from sharing gardens. I started filling the space with MôS collective activities to inspire passers by with immunity super foods for earth and ourselves. I hung art and permaculture costumes. By the end of May, I had accumulated the entire 10 years of the MoS LoBSter MoBster Pedagogy.</p>

<p>How do we activate these incredible resources and educational materials that are in the space during Covid? It’s full of everything we need. By learning lessons of biology, pollution remediation, and the restoration of nature and ourselves we can create healthy supply chains and recourse flows. </p>

<p>Help us forge pathways to betterment. Doing it requires community, face-to-face interaction. </p>

<p>We are now doing this during unimaginable difficulties but we can use this time to teach valuable skills. We want to bring people outside to this breezy plaza with masks on, leave with their fun homework to connect with the community further online. The locals are invited, along with prestigious guests to share ideas and stories which builds the world we want to see. (Next phase is building the game). </p>
