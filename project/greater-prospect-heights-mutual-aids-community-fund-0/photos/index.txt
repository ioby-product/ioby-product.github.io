17:T64d,<p>Greater Prospect Heights Mutual Aid (GPHMA) is a neighborhood network that provides material, emotional and informational support to residents of Prospect Heights and other nearby neighborhoods. Formed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working to build up an organization that can endure beyond the current crisis.</p>

<p>In the past few months, we have been helping neighbors maintain communication through platforms like Whatsapp and Slack. Through our regular community calls, we’ve also been providing opportunities for neighbors to engage in meaningful discussion on issues such as police violence, housing justice and mental health.</p>

<p>Since April, the mainstay of our efforts to provide direct aid to neighbors has been our grocery support program, which helps financially constrained neighbors acquire food and other basic household items on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Beyond helping neighbors get food, GPHMA’s grocery  program aims to build enduring relationships between volunteer shoppers and grocery recipients.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have been funneling volunteers towards a number of critical initiatives (from food distribution to voter registration to supplies drives) led by groups outside GPHMA.</p>
