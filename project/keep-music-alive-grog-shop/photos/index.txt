17:T964,<p>This series is a celebration of music and community. Thanks to the successes of  Cleveland Rocks: Past, Present &amp; Future and the NEO Music Relief Fund, the first of our concert series features Liz Kelly and Michelle Gaw, 2 recipients of the grant and will take place on Wednesday September 30 at the Grog Shop. The future shows will start on Thursday Oct 15 and run weekly through the end of the year.  Confirmed bands include  Bwak Dwagon, Orange Animal, Glamgore Drag Show featuring DJ Zoe Lapin, Punch Drunk Tagalongs, Nights, and more. We will pair up with a beloved Cleveland Heights restuarants for each one to provide light snacks. MOJO world eats and drinks, Zhug, Melt, Marottas, The Tavern Company, Boss Dog, Kensington Pub,  and CHIMI are some of the fine food partners who will be involved. We intend to sell limited distanced tables for a unique in person experience that we have all been missing for the past 6 months. </p>

<p>We hope build on the is model of the weekly Thursday shows and slowly add more programming to the Grog Shop's schedule. Your donations will provide will ensure  guaranteed income to all performers and production staff. A portion of the funding will go directly to each restaurant to purchase gift cards as thank you rewards for the donors. If we exceed our goal, we will add additional shows. </p>

<p>A full schedule of events with details on each band will be on the Grog Shop website, www.grogshop.gs.</p>

<p>The Grog Shop is a pivotal part of the Coventry neighborhood and Cleveland Heights at large and want to continue our mission to support Cleveland musicians. The COVID pandemic has forced us to shut our doors, and we want to keep music alive. We are shuttered by necessity and are trying to find new and safe ways to showcase our community and continue to provide our fans with a semblance of the live music feel. The transition to live streaming with small safely distanced live audiences has been a challenge, but one The Grog Shop is committed to take on. We have spent the past 6 months transforming our space so that we can try and have small groups enjoy music in person and also offer live streams to those at home.  The monies raised will help  Cleveland Heights Independent Businesses to survive over the next few months, as we wait for the live music industry return to normal.</p>

<p> </p>
18:T736,<p>To help keep live music alive and support independent Cleveland Heights businesses like the Grog Shop. The Grog Shop has been a staple in the Coventry Village neighborhood for 28 years. We opened our doors in 1992 as a corner bar with live music and have grown into a destination concert venue which strived to showcase original music 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The COVID pandemic has forced us to shut our doors, and we are trying to re-invent our mission while we wait for things to return to normal. We are shuttered by necessity and are tryng to find new and safe ways to showcase our comminity and continue to provide our fans with a semblance of the live music feel. The transition to live streaming with small safely distanced live audiences has been a challenge, but one The Grog Shop is committed to take on. We have spent the past 6 months transforming our space so that we can try and have small groups enjoy music in person and also offer live streams to those at home. The concerts will provide income to local musicians, production people, Grog Shop staff members and help foster a sense of connectivity in the community. </p>

<p>The Grog Shop has played host to countless local, national, and international touring acts for nearly 30 years, booking all ranges of indie rock, hip-hop, hardcore, jam, reggae, metal, electronic, comedy… You get the idea. Coventry, once the counter culture ground zero of Cleveland, is now a family friendly mix of eclectic independent shops and restaurants and the Grog Shop is a key achor. We employ thousands of musicians a year and also provide a much needed outlets for the music community at large. For many, the live music venues of our city, provide a safe space to come together with like minded people and enjoy a cultural experience that can not be found elsewhere.</p>
