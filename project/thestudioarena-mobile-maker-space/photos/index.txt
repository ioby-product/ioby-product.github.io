18:T61d,<p><span>The Foundation of Women in Hip Hop is </span><span>excited to bring </span><span>a new program called </span><span>thestudioArena Mobile Maker Space to launch at this year's annual Dilla Youth Day event on February 12th, 2017 at The Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Our aim is to not only nurture Youth with their creative experience at this event but we also want to expand this new program to reach communities after the event. </span></p>
<p><span>The Foundation of Women in Hip Hop </span><span>utilizes Hip Hop as a tool for community engagement, youth development, building community through collaboration, and most importantly nurturing people.</span><span>  We </span><span>have been leading Dilla Youth Day for 6 years.</span><span> </span><span>Dilla Youth Day is an annual event celebrating and sharing the legacy of one of the most prolific Music Producers in our time to l</span><span>earn the history of the Dilla Production Style in order to preserve this unique culture of Hip Hop. </span></p>
<p><span>February 2017, we aim to launch thestudioArena Mobile Maker Space that will combine the unique genius traditions of Hip Hop's powerful visual, musical, and performing art forms,</span><span> together</span><span> with the genius </span><span>hackers and makers with a </span>vision inspired by the strong spirit of invention in Detroit as home to many musical and technological movements that have had global impact such as the reign of Motown soul, the birth of Techno, and the assembly line. </p>
19:T744,<div>
	<p><span>Our hope from thestudioArena Mobile Maker Space is to give youth; hands on learning directly from professionals in the industry, positive experiences with learning about technology, math and science, many young people in our neighborhood don't get from their classroom experience, youth will have a chance to touch, make, &amp; take things home from this maker space program, have a a fun, transformative experience in technology.</span></p>
	<p><span>With the removal of arts and Culture from Public Education, </span><span>Youth are introduced to the history of the culture of Mechanical Ingenuity of Detroit. W</span><span>e aim to give more opportunities to young people to become makers and learn practical skills that can be applied to their own creative process. We Created this Free and open experience as a fun, compelling, hands-on program that inspires young learners in S.T.E.A.M. (Science Technology, Engineering, Arts, &amp; Math) disciplines, connecting youth to technologies in order to help them realize the creative potential of cutting-edge hardware and software tools. </span><span>This fun collaborative environment provides unique learning experiences for youth who will evolve into our next generation of innovators to learn by doing as they take part in exploratory immersive hands-on workshops accessing technologies. </span><span>This is the perfect spot for tech-savvy young digital minds interested in arts, technology and multi-media. </span></p>
	<p>We are launching this participatory experience during Black History Month to highlight the legacy of Black Innovators. In keeping with the DIY spirit of these many Innovators we are connecting the next generation to their own more recent history by highlighting a hometown figure of the HipHop Generation.</p>

	This is a two-phase project.</div>
<div>
	Phase I: Fundraise $10k to purchase the supplies and equipment that are needed for youth to be able to make and print and build stuff from so they can take these items home. Also to to create this experiential day for our youth at thestudioArena pop up Mobile Maker Space event. </div>
<div>
	Phase II: Fundraise to purchase equipment to to create a mobile maker space and be able bring this program experience to Youth other neighborhoods in detroit.</div>
<p><span>We achieve an information loop by connecting Professional Music Producers &amp; Community Leaders with youth to teach them a variety of skills and techniques and expose them to high and low tech equipment. </span><span>thestudioArena Mobile Maker Space combines the unique genius traditions of Hip Hop’s powerful musical, visual, and performing arts, with the genius engineers, hackers, innovators of DIY Making and Maker Spaces to catalyze the energy of youth, teen and adult communities to create an experience of innovation in sound, lighting, and motion technology. based on the “Disco-Tech” (discovering technology) model created by The Detroit Digitial Justice Technology Coalition that bridges the digital divide by helping underserved communities gain access to technology. </span></p>
