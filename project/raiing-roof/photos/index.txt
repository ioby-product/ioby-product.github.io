17:T69f,<p>Since its founding in 1994, East End Community Thrift has served as a pillar of the Garfield community. Everyone at this all volunteer-run thrifty shop decided to reopen our doors to stay connected to community during the pandemic, when even more people than usual need affordable clothes, household items, and a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our beloved thrift store's roof sprang a leak, and is in need of repair!</p>

<p>As school begins and the need for winter coats and clothing grows, it's so important we keep Thrifty's doors open to provide the Pittsburgh community with the winter clothing to keep everyone warm. These urgent roof repairs will keep rainstorms from disrupting our electrical systems and the heartwarming energy of our volunteers. That's why we need your help to fund roof repairs to keep Thrifty running.</p>

<p>After over 25 years, Thrifty remains rooted in the history and heartbeat of our Garfield neighborhood. In an everchanging strip, Thrifty welcomes all people with grace and care. Beyond offering stylish choices at truly affordable prices, Thrifty brings people together in a time when many feel so disconnected. We welcome every neighbor and Our volunteers often build relationships with longtime customers, sometimes setting aside special items matching their personal style and needs.</p>

<p>Thrifty also works with local shelters and social service agencies to distribute vouchers people can redeem for free clothing and household items. In 2019, customers redeemed over $10,000 of these vouchers for items they chose themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Donate now while donations are DOUBLED with ioby here on this page!</strong></p>
