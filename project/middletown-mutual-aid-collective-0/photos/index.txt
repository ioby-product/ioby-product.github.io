The funds raised here will be redistributed among community efforts that are delivering fresh and nutritious food to our neighbors.  Based on the requests we receive, we will collaborate to determine the best way to distribute funds with the majority of them going to local food relief efforts that are providing immediate relief to individuals experiencing food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

14:T568,<p>Mutual aid is people helping people. We have all types of needs: housing, food, medical, emotional, social, and more. We can meet them ourselves.</p>

<p>Middletown Mutual Aid Collective (MMAC) does work throughout the community by meeting each other’s needs as they come. We are a <a href="https://www.middletownmutualaid.org/#collective"><strong>collective</strong></a>, which means we come together as a group and make decisions together to address what needs to be done in our community. Right now, our work is centered around two projects: the Middletown Community Fridge and Direct Cash Assistance.</p>

<p>Read more about our projects and how to get involved at <a href="http://middletownmutualaid.org"><u>middletownmutualaid.org</u></a>!</p>

15:T543,<p>Over the past year, Middletown Mutual Aid has been running a network to help local people work in community with one another and meet their needs in new ways. We started by crowdfunding money (posting online requesting donations) and using the donated money to  deliver cleaning supplies, PPE, groceries, and other supplies to community members who expressed their need. We also started our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MiddletownMutualAid"><u>Facebook group </u></a>where Middletown residents can post needs, offerings, and opportunities to join the organizing.</p>

<p>In June of 2020, we began our direct cash assistance program. We give cash aid requesters a one-time payment of $200 with no questions asked. We have been able to give cash payments of $200  to over 300 residents. Over the summer, our financial director worked in person at the North End Action Team Office every Saturday to meet with requesters and make sure that we were accessible both online and in person. </p>

<p> We have heard many positive stories of the cash assistance payments helping with rent, medical bills, transportation to work, and more.  As of mid-May 2021, we still have around 540 people waiting on our list to receive assistance. We need support to help fill this gap and fulfill our promises to the community.</p>
