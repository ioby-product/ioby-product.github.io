	<strong>THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING THIS CAMPAIGN! </strong><strong>This campaign was a total success.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>10 youth were able to present on a Youth Empowerment panel on Wednesday from 4:30pm-5:45pm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 local youth organizations were a part of this panel. </strong></p>
<p><strong>21 youth and 5 staff and volunteers from 3 organizations were able to participate in STL Youth Smart Growth Leaders on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. </strong>The programming started early in the morning and lasted all day, as youth used their leadership training and interview training to interact with adults at the conference and to learn as much about smart growth as they could.</p>
<p><strong>7 more youth from Grand Center Arts Academy and Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School were able to come and present their prior Ethnodrama films on Saturday. </strong>Their families came as well to see the films they had created and to encourage their youth. After showing their films, the youth engaged a full room in discussion about their research into segregation, where it comes from, and how smart growth can help. Adults responded to the youth leaders by wrapping their arms around them. Together, youth and conference attendees identified the sources to segregation and problem-solved solutions. There were many tears. There was much healing. And parents and conference attendees asked how they could be a part of supporting and funding the program.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>FURTHER DONATIONS FOR ETHNODRAMA PROGRAMS: </strong></h3>
<p>Community Allies is now in the process of launching a new campaign that will go towards schools and programs that have requested this programming. For now, you can continue to donate to this campaign. All funding will go towards these ethnodrama programs. Community Allies will use part of this funding to hire youth who can serve as technology specialists and as mentors to students and teachers who participate in this programming.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>COMMUNITY PARTNERS NEEDED: </strong></h3>
<p>If you are an organization or an individual who would like to get involved, we welcome you to join an emerging network of supporters in these areas: marketing, fundraising, technology, business and business planning, educational connections, youth organizing, youth programming, city leadership, (you may have other ideas--we welcome them). Together, we can support the many schools and youth organizations who serve our youth daily and wrap our arms around youth who navigate such challenging waters and whose voices need to have a central role in our communities. Additionally, we are always working to connect youth to internship and employment opportunities so connecting to this network can help you locate stellar youth leaders. Please contact Sarah Hobson, sarah.hobson@communityalliesconsulting.com to plug in.</p>

<h2>
	<strong>Support efforts to ensure that St. Louis youth leaders and teachers are better equipped to help make the region more sustainable!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong>         </p>
<p>Community Allies is organizing its program “STL Youth Smart Growth Leaders” around sustainability issues that are connected to the renowned, national New Partners for Smart Growth Conference. “STL Youth Smart Growth Leaders” will help connect 50 students (and their teachers) to local government and other community leaders and give them a role in several smart growth community-led projects that will take place before, during and after the conference. These efforts will also connect teachers and students from the St. Louis region (including East St. Louis) who are exploring the implementation of smart growth principles. Students and teachers will learn from smart growth leaders how to address several key challenges in the region. Learning outcomes for youth, teachers, schools, and programs will be researched following Institutional Review Board ethically-approved processes.</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong>          </p>
<p>Middle school and high school-age youth from several schools and after-school programs across the region will engage in the multiple activities planned for before, during and after the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Who else:      </strong></p>
<p>Teachers and Parents. Teachers who are already incorporating smart growth principles into their curriculum and would like to learn more about new tools and innovative strategies to better their communities. Community Allies will help them coordinate learning opportunities for students through the program development that will be taking place before and during the conference. Through “STL Youth Smart Growth Leaders,” teachers will have the opportunity to connect with a range of current and new St. Louis smart growth youth programs.</p>
