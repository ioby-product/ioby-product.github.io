<p><b>Deer Fencing at Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary: $4066</b></p>

<p>The fencing was going to be donated and installed by Webster Bank at a corporate outing at the Sanctuary but had to be canceled due to pandemic.  We are hoping to fundraise for the fence and install it ourselves so we can continue with our crop plans.</p>

17:T74a,<p>Real Food Share is a non-profit in Newtown, CT formed by an amazing group of volunteers that value community, the environment, and supporting those in need.  Our team's incredible efforts have put us in the position to donate 100 baskets of fresh produce every week to food-insecure families in our community. </p>

<p>We are hard at work maximizing the amazing opportunities and diverse resources available in town.  Last year we partnered with Sticks and Stones Farm, restoring their 10,000 sq/ft giving garden.  The NHS Greenery Class was our second partner, as we harvested their outdoor gardens during the summer in the absence of their class.  In all, we donated over 700lbs of produce to the FAITH Food Pantry, the Nunnawauk Meadows Retirement Community, and the Senior Center.  We have added a third production partner for 2020, the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary, as we are preparing to manage the 30 raised beds in the middle of their restored meadows.</p>

<p>All of the land we are managing will be treated following the principles of regenerative agriculture, placing a primary focus on the health of the soil and surrounding environments.  We are prepared to be a hub for any volunteers interested or needing hours in agriculture, food security, or environment-friendly practices.  We will have class offerings, resources, and workshops available for what we consider 21st Century Health Skills: healthy food identification, nutrition education, simple food preparation, and horticulture basics.  </p>

<p>Outreach efforts are ongoing to publicize our message as we strive to meet our donation goal this upcoming season.  With your help, not only can we produce enough food for our community members, but we can serve as a hyper-local example for neighboring towns on how to maximize resources for the greater good.</p>

right for everyone.  Our society has a disconnection from our food sources unlike any other time in history.   Food typically travels 1500 miles from farm to plate, with 50% of its nutrition depleted

simple and beautiful practice that we are only a generation removed from.  Maximizing available resources, partnerships, and volunteer efforts are the foundation of a hyper-local food system
