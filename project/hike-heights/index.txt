18:T729,<p>On June 1, 2014, CLIMB (City Life Is Moving Bodies) and its community partners will be celebrating our annual hike through Northern Manhattan parks.  Hike the Heights is an annual volunteer-planned and community run event that links 2,000+ local residents with their beautiful parks in Northern Manhattan, including “Giraffe Path,” an urban trail that connects 7 parks and surrounding neighborhoods. This family-friendly event brings together people of all ages for hiking and a community party with arts, games, healthy food, and active fun in their parks.</p>
<p><strong>We connect people with the parks in their communities.</strong> Hike the Heights shows local residents the natural resources that exist in their own back yard to encourage them to engage with and use the parks, making them safer for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>We build community through the arts.</strong>  In preparation for the event, local children from Head Start groups, pediatric clinical facilities, and local schools work with CLIMB and our community partners to create giraffe scultpures from recycled materials.  On the day of the event, these giraffes decorate the parks and line the hiking trails, lending a playful feel to the volunteer-led tours through parks previously marked by violence. </p>
<p><strong>We promote environmental stewardship.</strong>  Before Hike the Heights, CLIMB and its partners host park clean-up and trail maintenance days so local residents can give back to the parks that give them so much.</p>
<p><strong>We bridge communities</strong>.  Hiking along the giraffe path bridges the divide between surrounding neighborhoods.  Neighbors from Central Harlem and Washington Heights/Inwood hike along the giraffe path and interact with one another, strengthening bonds an building community.</p>
<p> </p>
19:T856,<p>Open spaces and parks in large urban areas are invaluable. The diverse residents who use these spaces – from toddlers to seniors, joggers to strollers – enhance their quality and vibrancy. Northern Manhattan has an extensive network of paved and unpaved park trails that can take a hiker from 110th street to 218th street through beautiful urban parks and past breathtaking natural vistas. Community partners lovingly refer to the network of trails as the "Giraffe Path" because, on a map, the parks form a green giraffe-shaped oasis where local residents can escape the hustle and bustle of city life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these parks and places along the "giraffe path" trail have been forgotten by locals who retreated from parks during the epidemic of violence that plagued Northern Manhattan in the 1980s and early 1990s.  Volunteer groups and the City Parks Department have brought these parks and surrounding neighborhoods a long way on the path to restoration and, though some additional maintenance work is required, what these spaces need now is increased foot traffic (and bike, rollerblade, wheelchair, &amp; stroller traffic as well!).  Neighbors and visitors must be invited to come out and learn about these trails. We have found that once residents learn about their parks, they fall in love with the trails and are more likely to be involved in park stewardship and other community volunteer activities.  In coming together for a celebration at the Sunken Playground, lovingly referred to by locals as "The Pit", we hope to encourage others to reclaim these parks and public spaces, using them as they would their own backyard, increasing physical, social, civic activity in the neighborhoods they are in. </p>
<p>CLIMB and Hike the Heights seek to raise awareness about these public spaces and build a sense of community pride and ownership over them.  Parks are important community assets for public health and community well-being.  By connecting neighbors with their parks, we hope to promote healthy lifestyles and community advocacy for these beautiful natural assets. </p>
<p> </p>
