18:T710,<p>It's time to<strong> celebrate Sacramento's arts and cultural communities</strong> and <strong>promote cultural tourism</strong> within our city!</p>

<p><strong>articulator: Sacramento Edition</strong> is a 300-page, full-color book that features six extensive interviews with Sacramento artists and cultural leaders: <strong>Gioia Fonda, Estella Sanchez, Barbara Range, Liv Moe, Harley White Jr.</strong>, and <strong>Trisha Rhomberg</strong>. The interviews include perspectives on building and supporting the creative community, the importance of workforce development, Sacramento's Creative Edge Plan, and the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship in the arts.</p>

<p>articulator: Sacramento Edition also includes six spotlights of Sacramento artists chosen by the main interviewees. These artists include <strong>Manuel Fernando Rios, Xico Gonzalez, Shonna McDaniels, Aida Lizalde, Milton 510 Bowens</strong>, and <strong>Penelope Lenaerts</strong>.</p>

<p>We're excited to partner with IOBY and the City of Sacramento on this fundraising campaign to continue to amplify the artists and art resources of our city to out-of-town visitors. By donating to our campaign, you help us print the 2nd edition of <strong>articulator: Sacramento Edition</strong>, which will allow us to distribute it to 10 Sacramento hotels, reaching over 300,000 new individuals and bringing more business to our Sacramento arts institutions and venues.</p>

<p>We also plan to continue our series of artist talks at the Kimpton Sawyer Hotel.  We held our first talk with Gioia Fonda just before the pandemic to a packed house, and we're excited to continue this series this summer.  You can <strong>watch Gioia's art talk <a href="https://youtu.be/LgcGHBoBUYI" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
19:T40f,<p>We believe that sharing these stories and art with the visitor market promotes <strong>Cultural Tourism </strong>and is a great way to promote the galleries, venues, small businesses, and restaurants still recovering from the financial setbacks caused by the pandemic.</p>

<p>With your support, we will provide free, full-page ads to the cultural institutions, galleries, and shops featured in the book, along with amenity maps of<strong> the R Street Corridor, and the Midtown, Handle, and Oak Park districts</strong> to promote Sacramento's arts and culture to our out-of-town visitors.  </p>

<p>This is where you come in; we've already raised $40,000 toward our goal of $80,000 and need your help in sponsoring free ads for the people who make our city artistically and culturally vibrant!  <strong>While we have specific levels outlined in the giving section, we appreciate your support at any level, from $10 and up.  As a bonus, the City of Sacramento will match up to $1,000 for each donation!  </strong></p>
1a:T4dd,<p><strong>articulator: Sacramento Edition</strong> will be distributed as an in-room amenity to over<strong> 2,800 hotel rooms in the downtown, midtown, and Cal Expo district</strong>s, giving over <strong>300,000 visitors to Sacramento</strong> an opportunity to learn more about Sacramento's Arts and Cultural Districts. We are proud to share the stories and art of Sacramento artists with visitors in partnership with the Sacramento Hotel Association and the following hotels:</p>

<p>• <strong>The Citizen Hotel</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Courtyard Marriott &amp; Fairfield Inn Cal Expo</strong></p>

<p><strong>• DoubleTree by Hilton Sacramento</strong></p>

<p><strong>• The Exchange Hotel - Curio by Hilton</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Fort Sutter Hotel Sacramento</strong></p>
