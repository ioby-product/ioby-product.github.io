16:T617,<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I work with an environmental non-profit called Ecologic Institute and this is our story.</p>
<p>In partnership with another local non-profit called Sustainable San Mateo County we publish the Sustainable San Mateo County Indicators Report. It is the longest, continuously running local sustainability report in the US - the 17th edition is due on May 21, 2013.</p>
<p>The report informs residents of San Mateo County on what is happening in their communities in what we call the 3Es of sustainability: (a) Economy, (b) Equity and (c) Environment.</p>
<p>Using some 40 indicators, and an annually changing focal theme, that are carefully researched by a small staff of 2 and many local volunteers, we show the current trends and useful advice on (a) WHAT residents can do to positively change their communities, (b) WHERE to get more information, and (c) HOW local success stories have made an impact.</p>
<p>While we are proponents of sustainability, we do not take policy positions unless we are asked to do so, because we see value in letting the numbers do the talking and people come to their own conclusions.</p>
<p>Here is now where we seek your help: due to a significant shortfall in our recent annual fundraising event the release of the 2013 report is in jeopardy. While we are hopeful to fill the gap in time for the 2014 report, we are seeking to raise $7,800 to cover current production costs, including putting it online and printing a small number of reports for use in local schools, libraries, and city councils.</p>
17:T7b8,<p>We are passionate about San Mateo County and know that its residents care about their community, the environment and the economy.</p>
<p>A lot of information is available online now, but local information -- meaning census-tract to county information on everything from local air pollution to affordable housing construction projects and pockets of poverty -- is scattered and difficult to access to non-expert users. People are also busy and sometimes the information needs to come to them to spark a thought, a conversation and ultimately action. Our report delivers this information in a clean, appealing report, free of charge, for 17 years.</p>
<p>But it does not stop there. The report offers small and bigger solutions to environmental, social and economic problems, highlights local initiatives that are innovative or simply demonstrate a deep sense of community engagement and have measurable impacts.</p>
<p>Our annually changing key theme picks up on a current hot-topic, be it water demand and supply, green buildings, or efficient transportation systems and puts it under a magnifying lense to give residents a deeper understanding of the challenges and potential solutions.</p>
<p>We are convinced that there is a need for this kind of local information delivery and our dedicated team at Ecologic Institute and Sustainable San Mateo County (there is 4 of us in total) and many volunteers are working hard to keep the report alive while adapting it to the benefits of the Internet and new technologies. Our total operating budget for 9 months of work is a little of $30,000. Unfortunately, our March fundraising dinner and sustainability awards ceremony fell short of raising the funds needed to complete the 2013 report and embark on the 2014 edition. That is why we reach out to you to make sure the almost finished report will see the light of day and be once again an information source our residents now is there when and wherever they need it.</p>
18:T7d7,<p>A recent user survey that we conducted found that more than 80% of users find the information useful in their daily lives or at work. The report was used by teachers (and us) to talk about sustainability issues with elementary and high school students (every year we have 10-15 students from Mills High School help us research selected indicators), realtors to inform potential new county residents about the county's and cities' amenities, and elected officials (one saying he keeps a copy in his car at all times to take it to council meetings), including now state senator Jerry Hill.</p>
<p>As a grassroots initiative, the report and the information it provides has served us in countless conversations with residents, city and county council members, and other local organizations. By presenting local approaches, it helps to empower people. They get ideas on how to become more environmentally conscious in their daily lives (e.g., planting drought-resistant gardens, participating in outdoor recreation activities, joining a car-share initiative, and many initiatives that we featured and provided contact information for).</p>
<p>Every year the report is launched in a free-public event for which we organize a panel of knowledgeable, local speakers to talk about what's new, what's pressing, and what the solutions might be. More than 80 people attended last year's launch, we receive much positive and constructive feedback and know that the participants always leave with more knowledge and motivation to affect positive change than when they arrived.</p>
<p>Many indicator projects, local to national, have been started in the 20+ years since first Rio Summit and the Brundtland Commission's pathbreaking report. But many have failed, fizzled, or did not have much impact. The Sustainable San Mateo County Indicator Report has informed thousands of residents since its launch 17 years ago. We would like to continue this legacy and make it an even better one today and in the future.</p>
