14:T14e1,<p>***********UPDATE APRIL 30TH***********</p>
<p>With all of your generous support, UproarLA met our initial fundraising goal which was established in the early days of this fight!  New neighborhood groups/members have expressed an interest in donating to our cause, and we are so appreciative of this possibility.  Therefore, we have increased the previous budget in order to explore additional near-term legal strategies with our attorney, Matt Adams, of Dentons, LLP.  Please visit the Update/Budget tabs for more information.</p>
<p>************************************************</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong><strong>:  </strong><span>UproarLA is a unified coalition of Los Angeles residents, parents and environmentalists committed to stopping the FAA's attempt to establish narrow, low altitude flight paths over our schools, homes, neighborhoods and the Santa Monica Mountains.  </span></p>
<p><span>Our group includes residents from North Hollywood, Toluca Lake, Studio City, Valley Village, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Hollywood Hills, Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon, Beverly Glen, Bel Air, and other areas.  It includes a large number of concerned parents from many of the impacted schools, comprised of over 10,000 students, including: Carpenter Elementary, Colfax Elementary, Dixie Canyon Elementary, Sherman Oaks Elementary, Campbell Hall, Oakwood School, Buckley School, Harvard-Westlake School, Sunnyside Preschool, Millikan Middle School, and Walter Reed Middle School.</span></p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO WE WANT?: </strong><span>The FAA has proposed a new Superhighway of Jets (created by two new flight paths out of Burbank Airport) that will have a devastating effect on all communities underneath.  We want to protect all the communities under the flight paths including all affected schools, homes, and neighborhoods; and parks, protected open spaces, trails, recreation areas, and wildlife in the Santa Monica Mountains — our oases in the heart of LA.  People on the ground deserve paths that don't subject our children, schools, homes, and neighborhoods to low altitude jets, noise, and toxic pollutants; paths that don't jeopardize our safety; and protection for our parks and wildlife.  We want true and meaningful inclusion in a legally-required process to achieve a safe, equitable and environmentally sound resolution to this public controversy.  </span></p>
<p><span>A critical part of our mission is the education and mobilization of all affected people in the above-mentioned communities.  The FAA process is burdensome, opaque and designed to confuse.  We seek to provide accurate and important information for the good of the public.  People need all of the information to make an informed choice for their families and communities!  UproarLA was created to reach as many people as possible, not focusing on any one community or school.</span></p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL?:  </strong>W<span>e have hired our own lawyers on behalf of LA residents. We are working with a nationally recognized environmental attorney we retained to help LA residents navigate this process with the FAA, Matthew Adams of Dentons, LLP.  Based in San Francisco, Mr. Adams is a Partner and Chair of the firm's US Environment and Natural Resources practice.  He is well-versed in the laws at issue.  Mr. Adams and Dentons are the same attorneys hired by Phoenix residents in their successful lawsuit against the FAA. Mr. Adams will work alongside the law firm of Kaplan Kirsch &amp; Rockwel as they represent the City of LA (just as they worked together in the Phoenix litigation). </span></p>
<p><span>Having an attorney represent LA residents' interests is vital to our success.  We need his advice and expertise to help us protect the Santa Monica Mountains, the children at the impacted schools, and all of the homes under this Jet Superhighway.  Mr. Adams also will guide us on which, if any, experts should be hired, studies that should be conducted, and other litigation preparation and litigation legal issues/strategies.</span></p>

						<strong><span>All funds raised to date, and in the future, solely relate to UproarLA’s legal efforts to fight the FAA’s new proposed flight paths out of Burbank Airport. Our attorney, Matt Adams, is representing, advising and potentially litigating and negotiating on our behalf as related to Burbank Airport’s proposed new procedures.</span></strong><br />
						 </div>
					<div>
						<strong><span>We have a unique opportunity with Burbank Airport and are taking advantage of the recently closed comment period and timeliness of our challenge there.  That open legal window is why UproarLA hired Matt Adams.  Therefore, all legal expenses incurred are for the Burbank Airport legal battle, and any money raised goes exclusively to that specific effort. </span></strong></div>
