17:T61d,<p>Our School's Wilderness Club is raising money to get supplies and train tickets to take an overnight, back-country camping trip upstate. There is a DIY element to our club, and students learn survival skills while learning about nature. We have already built home-made fishing poles from tree saplings, and used them to fish the East River.</p>
<p>For the camping trip, students will learn how to make their own shelters with tarp and rope, as well as learn to sew by making their own primitive sleeping bags. We have a dehydrator that we’ll use to dehydrate our own food to pack on the hike. Our goal is to take Metro-North to the Appalachian Trail Metro-North Railroad station, hike out for half a day, set up camp, practice various survival skills, and return to the city the next day. We are trying to raise enough money to do a day hike prior to the overnight hike for practice.</p>
<p>One of the goals of our after-school club is to expose inner-city, immigrant students to the variety of native habitats of New York State. All of our students have recently immigrated to the United States and are new to English. Many of them were more in touch with nature in their native countries, and one of the hardships of their immigration <span>experience is to be deprived of nature here in the city.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to raise $1800 for Metro-North tickets, $300 for food stuffs, and $500 for DIY supplies (fabric, down, line, tarps, wire, and first aid materials).</span></p>

<div>
	Hi my name is Ricky Gomez i am 14 years and as growing up in the Dominican republic i have feel natural very close. This is the first reason why i sign in to the wilderness club I really like the life you live in the country because just feeling the fresh air in your face is a bless from god. My family and i move to new York for new opportunities but i really miss my old life. As you know new York is full of pollution in very numerals ways this is why i really need the opportunity to get a chase to again remember how does it feels to live in the healthy environment of nature before it goes away for ever......</div>
<div>
	Ratri (Bangladesh):</div>
<div>
	There are some reason why I want to be in Wilderness club. One reason I want to be in wilderness club is because my goal was to  keep practice running because as I remember when I was a kid In my country I got award running for 1st place of running. The weird thing is now, I can run as fast as I done before because I stopped running long time ago. I also have lots of prizes for 1st and second place winner. I also agreed to Lilette win what she said about the nature of her country which is Myanmar  because according to what she said In my country Bangladesh  there really excellent place for adventure. I also went to lots of places like that because my dad also like adventure. This are the reasons why I am in wilderness club. I love nature because of different trees , birds , river and hills. I had 4 birds in my country they are four different color . These are orange , blue , yellow , ash with white. I loved them and they was so close to me because whenever I went close to them they make some sound that shows that  they are happy to see me. Everyday I had see them after I awake because If I don’t see them I feel like My day be bad today. Other than that I always keep meet with them.</div>

	Edison (Ecuador):</div>
<div>
	My name is Edison Tenezaca. I'm 16 years old and and from Ecuador. When i was in ecuador i use to live around nature but when i move to united state i miss the nature, stars around the sky and the stars leak fly in the milky way. I join the wilderness clus so i could be active and know the nature and be close. I have notice that the planet is warming up  because people don't respect the nature. When we go camping we will have our knowledge how we could treat the nature to not destroy more and how we could use our DIY skill to make different object with our hand. For example, the fishing pole.</div>
<div>
	Lilette (Myanmar):</div>
<div>
	There are several reasons why I want to be in Wilderness Club. One would be because in Myanmar, which is the place I came from have a lot of beautiful nature. I grew up in that kind of place and I realized that in New York, you do not always get a chance to interact with nature. I remembered, as a kid, I would look up in the sky and stare at those countless beautiful twinkling stars, but in a city like this, you can no longer see the stars because of the lights from tall buildings are replacing its place. Another reason would be because of my personality. I love adventures and I am adventurous. I want to go camping and hiking in the wilderness simply because I love nature. To go on an adventure, I know that I would definitely be needing DIY skills and ways to protect myself. That is where the Wilderness Club comes in place. This club can teach me everything about wilderness and also, different skills to survive. That alone is enough reasons for me to be in Wilderness Club and I would definitely love to go to a place like Appalachian Trail which is surrounded by nature.</div>

			My name is Zhi Jie. I come from China .The reason why I join the club is that nowadays more and more people live in city ,they begin forgetting the beautiful sceneries of nature .I like nature .I like forest and river .They are the gifts from nature .When I looked at them ,I would feel relaxed ,I will forget the phone and annoyances .In addition ,it’s really cool that  we go to wildness then live without the High-tech tools and make food and tools by ourselves ! I learn some wildness skills in this club .I like this club ^ ^</div>
