18:T6ce,<p>We live in an economically diverse region that was especially hard-hit by the pandemic. Food insecurity is an unfortunate local reality, which recently encouraged our school district to start providing free meals to all students.</p>

<p>After our experiencences last year preparing and delivering meals for our neighbers facing pandemic-related and long-term food insecurity, we continued to want to aid those in need in our community by expanding their buying power at our market. Previously, we were only able to offer two sources of support: governmental food assistance (SNAP) and limited matching through an organization called Just Harvest, which provided 40 cents on the dollar.</p>

<p>Starting in 2020, we created our own match so that every $1 of food assistance resulted in $3 in buying power at the market. This program was a tremendous success; in total, the market was able to provide more than $8,500 in direct financial support to neighbors with severe food insecurity while directly supporting the efforts of local farmers. Given the progressive adoption of the program, a pandemic-truncated prior market season, persistent economic struggles, and word getting out about the project, we anticipate needing more than $15,000 to fund this program in 2021. </p>

<p>The farmers market works hard to minimize the stigma of our shoppers using the food assistance program -- for example, volunteers help mediate the secondary transaction necessary to reimburse shoppers without asking them to visit each vendor twice. Our work is imbued with dignity and respect for food-insecure recipients because the entire board lives in the 15202 area code and we consider each of the 10,122 eligible families our neighbors. </p>
