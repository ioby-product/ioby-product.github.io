17:Tf4f,<h4>
	We are celebrating the complex history of the Revolutionary War in our Pittsburgh region by placing a new historic marker at an iconic city intersection.</h4>
<p>The PA Historical &amp; Museum Commission has approved an official historical marker recognizing Simon Girty. The marker will be placed on the site of his former colonial farmstead in Pittsburgh. Girty was a controversial figure during the American Revolution. He had been captured and adopted by Seneca Indians as a child and grew to adulthood under the tutelage of Guyasuta, a great Seneca war chief who had acted as an intermediary between the colonists and his people. Simon Girty would eventually assume a similar role.</p>
<p>At the end of the French &amp; Indian War, the Native Americans of the Northwest Territories signed a treaty with the British which protected their claim to the lands beyond the Ohio River. They were required, however, to return all European captives. Thus in 1764, Simon Girty was returned to Fort Pitt by Guyasuta, himself. Here he was reunited with his mother Mary Turner and his four brothers. They claimed and settled a farmstead on Squirrel Hill, now straddling the Greenfield and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods. Simon, fluent in numerous Indian languages, and skilled in wilderness travel, joined the British Indian Department and became a scout, interpreter and intermediary with the Native Americans. At the outbreak of the Revolution, Simon was an officer in the Virginia Militia garrisoned at Fort Pitt. By 1778, he had clearly observed that the Americans coveted the Indian lands and intended to disregard the treaties. He defected to the British at Fort Detroit and immediately returned to the field of battle where he led and supplied the Native resistance to the American advances. He was an ally of Joseph Brant, Little Turtle, and Blue Jacket - the most celebrated Indian warriors of perhaps all time. He was also a mentor of Tecumseh, who would lead the next generation of Indians. After the Revolution, Indians from every region gathered at Auglaize in Western Ohio in 1794 to try to form a united front. US Secretary of War Knox reported to President Washington that Simon Girty was the only non-Indian invited to participate.</p>
<p>Girty was reviled and vilified by the new American nation and countless lurid and fabricated tales of atrocities were written about him. They were eventually disproved but the legacy lingers to this day. Regarded as a hero by the British, Canadians and the Indians, he was buried with full military honors in Canada. While there are numerous historical markers in the US denouncing him as a White Savage or The Great Renegade, this Pittsburgh historical marker will be the first to recognize his honorable conduct in resisting the Native American Genocide.</p>
<div>
	This text has been proposed for the marker. The final inscription will be unveiled at the dedication ceremony on September 30.</div>
<p>Simon Girty (1741 - 1818)</p>
<p>In 1756, Girty was captured and adopted by the Senecas. He grew to adulthood as a tribal member, but a 1764 treaty demanded his repatriation. Reunited with his family, he claimed a farm here while working as an interpreter and emissary at Fort Pitt. Increasingly aware that the Americans coveted the Indian lands, he "eloped" in 1778 to join the British and fight alongside the Indians on the western frontier. Vilified by Americans, he was valued by his Indian community as a trusted friend and military leader.</p>
<p>In addition to this official PA state plaque, we hope to create a more extensive outdoor signboard to tell the Girty story. <br />
	<strong>The dedication ceremony is set for September 30, 2017 and will be incorporated into the annual History Walk of nearby Turner Cemetery, where Simon's mother and a brother are buried, along with veterans of the first four American wars.</strong></p>
