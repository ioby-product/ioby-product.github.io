<p>With additional funds of <b>$7013.90</b>, we will be able to pay Beachland staff while we wait out the 2nd shutdown due to COVID…We are now closed for 30 days to help stop the spread so this planned concert series will be pushed back until safe, and in the meantime, staff will communicate with contributors about the delay in scheduling and distribute merch, but will still be able to keep their jobs while we plan yet another reopening. Thanks much to IOBY for making this possible.</p>

18:T489,<p>With COVID increasing again, it is clear that musicians and venues are going to continue to be financially hurt until sometime next year. As the booking manager at the Beachland Ballroom, a club that normally supports all styles of local musicians, we see the need to develop a live stream series so that we can help bands have both an online audience and a small in-house audience since our capacity now is only 64. To do this right we would like to acquire the proper equipment and develop a team of people to perfect the sound and video which can then be used by the local musicians long into the future for promotion and to gain future listeners on their own website. We, along with other small venues in Cleveland like Grog Shop, Happy Dog and Bop Stop and with the support of non-profit Cleveland Rocks: Past Present Future, have been building a network to help keep the local music scene viable while navigating through COVID's necessary shutdown and extremely reduced capacity. To this end, we propose to do 5 well-publicized shows with some of the best local original bands during the month of December that will be live-streamed and recorded.</p>

This will give Beachland the capacity to better help musicians get their product out into the world through internet presentations. We will then identify a group of local bands who have original material that this live streaming production can help and also we will be able to pay them for their creative work, which many of them have not had an opportunity to even do since the March shutdown, let alone be paid for it. These shows will be available for in-person viewing but only in a safe distance layout with just 16 tables available. So once the bands are selected we will start the information campaign to let people know and plan our live streaming broadcasting plans with BoxCast, the local company that will help with the technical aspects.
