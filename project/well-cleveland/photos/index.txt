17:T79c,<p><span>I'm Gloria Treister, a wellness infuencer, Board Certified Holistic Health Coach and US Ambassador for Global Wellness Day.  My goal is for Cleveland to function and be known as a healthy city and for Clevelanders to become healthier as a result of our efforts.  In a story that was recently released, of the top 184 Healthiest Companies in America, </span><b>NONE were from Cleveland</b><span>!  </span><a href="http://www.cleveland19.com/story/37816821/interactive-health-names-americas-healthiest-companies"><span>http://www.cleveland19.com/story/37816821/interactive-health-names-americas-healthiest-companies</span></a><span>  In a recent poll,</span><b> Cleveland was ranked 137 out of 174 for Healthiest US Cities</b><span>! Pittsburgh was 44th; Cincinnati was 66th and Buffalo ranked better at 89th! </span><a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/healthiest-cities/31072/"><span>https://wallethub.com/edu/healthiest-cities/31072/</span></a><span>  Together we can change that!  </span></p>
<p><span>The WELL Cleveland™ Project is an exciting, volunteer driven, not for profit project designed to engage individuals throughout Northeast Ohio and to connect our communities in healthy, sustainable activities, but in a more holistic way.  These activities focus on the 7-step manifesto for celebrating Global Wellness Day <strong>that includes improving the health of people, our planet, our communities and our families and helping people understand the connection between them all. </strong> “We hope the end result will be to improve the ranking of Cleveland in the standings for healthiest US cities and to raise the Wellness IQ and wellbeing of our citizens”, said Gloria, “and, we want to connect people in a positive way.”</span></p>
<p>To learn more about the history of Global Wellness Day and the basis for our 7 step program visit this website: https://www.globalwellnessday.org/</p>
<div>
	 </div>
18:Teb5,<p><span>Our team of dedicated volunteers have connected with organizations throughout Northeast Ohio who share the vision of improving the health and well-being of the citizens in our Northeast Ohio communities and at your company or organization.</span></p>
<p><span>We see this program as a guided path towards empowerment and positivity through education and encouragement focused on <strong>healthy eating</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong> by recognizing our contribution to plastic pollution and reducing our use, community through the doing of <strong>good deeds</strong>, <strong>solid families</strong> through the inspiration towards having technology-free family dinners, steps towards <strong>getting more activity</strong> into our days and <strong>encouraging better sleep</strong>.  <br />
	<br />
	The principles upon which this program is based are values to which we believe we can all ascribe.</span></p>
<p><strong>We want a better world and we intend to held pave the way!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Say yes to Wellness</strong>!  <strong>Say yes to a WELL Cleveland.</strong></p>
<p><br />
	“I fell in love with these 7 steps as they are more than the ‘eat this, don’t eat that and exercise’ type of wellness program we have grown accustomed to. <strong>We are, instead, incorporating the importance of the health of our planet, doing good for the community and each other, the importance of family with a strong focus on sustainability in the context of health and wellbeing</strong>.”  By helping people understand that all of these princlples work in concert with one another and that when we have good sustainability, comaraderie, strong families, only then can we all be well. </p>
<p>Our project is designed to shine a light on what is important and to raise awareness.  One example is from one of our 26 Cleveland companies that participated in our last 7 Weeks to Wellness Challenge.  During the week of "Don't Use Plastic Bottles", the challenge is designed for each individual to count their contribution to the plastics pollution problem.  Participants  were to count every piece of plastic that they put into the environment.  Every spoon, fork, cup, straw, container, etc. that they used and then discarded. This company wrote to us to say that "we did not realize how bad the plastic pollution problem had become. When we dug in a little deeper, we realized that there are floating plastic garbage patches in the ocean, and even in Lake Erie, that are composed of thousands of pounds of plastic waste.  This is affecting the quality of our water and our sea life and therefore, us!  As a result, this company immediately took steps to become more sustainabie and provided reusable water bottles, eliminated the use of straws on campus and encouraged the use of reusable containers of all types.  Not only are they now more sustainable, but they feel better about themselves and their company!</p>
<p>Another company shared that they began providing healthy, organic fruits and vegetables in their lunch room for their employees.  By buying organic and local, we are eliminating some of the toxic load from glyphosate and other chemicals used in conventional farming, the emissions realted to transporting food from far away places and therefore, once again, being kind to the planet.</p>
<p>It is our intention to take this information on the road and teach our program in more companies, organizations and also to get it into our schools. Our hope is that the lessons taught and learned will be shared throughout families and communities. We need these funds to build on what we have started and take this information to the public!  After all, knowledge is power.</p>
