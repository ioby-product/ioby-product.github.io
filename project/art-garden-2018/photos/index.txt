17:T120d,<p><strong>Art in the Garden</strong> is <a href="http://omapittsburgh.org/">OMA Pittsburgh</a>’s first educational program; it’s centered around investing in the resiliency and social and emotional development of Pittsburgh’s youth. Art in the Garden is a free summer program held in Borland Garden, an urban green space in East Liberty. We are particularly invested in meeting the needs of underserved youth. We believe that fostering the social emotional intelligence of the next generation—which often means helping youth develop tools to process and heal from trauma—is a critical component for a healthy, inclusive, and equitable society. We believe people of all ages thrive when they know healthy ways to recognize and express their emotions. <a href="http://ei.yale.edu/">Research</a> shows that when children can better recognize, understand, express and regulate their emotions, their emotional intelligence and social skills increase, anxiety and depression decrease, they are less likely to bully others, they have better academic performance, and they have stronger leadership skills. Above all, Art in the Garden seeks to enable youth to grow in their understanding of connectedness to themselves, each other, and our earth. This program supports youth in their knowing—in deep and lasting ways—the interconnectedness of all living beings, and the ways in which we are all whole and all belong.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Development: </strong>Our vision is for Pittsburgh to become a model for best practices in social &amp; emotional learning and in trauma informed care &amp; resilience. In order to support this vision, we are holding professional development seminars for Art in the Garden educators, community partners, staff, and other educators working with youth in community gardens. These seminars will support adults in developing mindfulness practices, strengthening conflict transformation skills, building skills that foster supportive relationships with youth, and supporting youth in developing resilience and social and emotional intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Community Partners: </strong>In addition to the core set of daily activities and free play model we have four community partner organizations who will visit Borland Garden to provide a unique learning experience for youth. </p>
<p><em>Balafon West African Dance Ensemble</em> instructors Mama Kadiatou Conte-Forte and Linsey McDaniel will bring music and dancing to youth each week. These sessions will teach youth about West African musical and performance traditions, using sound and movement as a tool for regulating emotions.</p>
<p><em>The Storymobile</em> from Reading is FUNdamental Pittsburgh will bring stories, activities, books, and literary resources to Art in the Garden. Each time The Storymobile visits, youth will be given a book to expand their home libraries.</p>
<p><em>The </em><em>Clay Workshop </em>with ceramic artist Sandra Moore, Shawn Terrell, and Diamond Beck will provide the tools and materials for youth to make a series of unique clay artifacts. Youth will learn about a variety of surface treatments such as burnishing, stamps, texture and glaze as well as the low fire technique called Horsehair Raku. As youth discuss what their clay piece needs to survive the firing, which they will do in a kiln built on site, they will also have the opportunity to discuss resilience and what they need to thrive in the face of challenges. Building on sequential firings, youth will learn to create more durable and better constructed pieces. Youth will also make blue marbles for the “<a href="http://www.wallacejnichols.org/130/blue-marbles.html" target="_blank">Blue Marble Project</a>” which they will be able to use throughout Art in the Garden and beyond as tokens of gratitude when they notice someone making a choice that helps take care of our blue planet. The Clay Workshops’ hands-on approach of student-lead creation is magical and empowering.</p>
<p><em>Perennial Abundance </em>with Sten Carlson is a response to the rapid pace of global climate change, and growing anxiety among youth about its effects on their future. Its purpose is to create a network of food forest school gardens to serve as outdoor classrooms where children will learn the regenerative practices needed to help stop and reverse climate change. Youth learn about and contribute to the emerging field of carbon farming, improve ecosystem health, increase food security, beautify their community, and produce high yields from widely useful plants.</p>
