17:Ta72,<p>The University District- the planning district in Mempis, TN that includes eight distinct neighborhoods that cradle the University of Memphis and link their two campuses and sports venue- is currently undergoing a redevelopment renaissance wherein real estate is in very high demand, and public greenspaces have become scarce for the communities that provide housing for students, faculty, staff and our bustling business district.  Previously, nonprofits in our area have leased vacant lots on which they've sponsored community gardens, but as demand increases, we find ourselves leaving behind the soil we've tendered to perfection, reinventing garden spaces every year, never enjoying the second-year fruits of our labor- healthy, rich, fertile soil that yields healthier, more predictable crops.  Moreover, the labor involved in relocating garden supplies, equipment and materials annually is causing attrition among our volunteers, making it nearly impossible to keep communities engaged over time.  </p>
<p>The Shelby County Land Bank offers us a solution-  a permanent home for gardening space for our district's neighborhoods.  On December 2, 2017, we will have the opportunity to bid at public auction on a vacant lot located in Sherwood Forest, where our "UD Renaissance" hasn't quite caught fire yet and there is no new housing demand that would inspire developer competition for this lot.  Anticipating eventual ownership, we began "squatting" on this  200' X 60' lot in March of this year, with 14 volunteer gardeners workinig 6'X20' plots of their own and one large community watermelon patch.  We've grown more tomatoes, squash, okra, cucumbers and peppers than our families could consume and have shared the excess with neighbors.  This, in turn, has generated more interest in our garden and more 'volunteers' to help tend the lot.  </p>
<p>Next year, we intend to devote half the lot to a large commercial garden and host pop-up produce sales (as we did last year on a leased lot we had to vacate for development). Last year, our gardeners hosted canning classes at St Luke's UMC and we hope to continue this tradition in partnership with the church and continue use of their state-of-the-art commercial catering kitchen.  And eventually, we aim to have a garden just like this one in each of our UD neighborhoods, when/if space becomes available with our ultimate goal being to offer certified organic produce year-round (using greenhouses) to neighbors and local restaurants.  </p>
<p>Please consider donating to help make UDistrict Farms a permanent fixture in Memphis.  Help us keep momentum going- help us 'buy the farm.!   </p>
18:T4e0,<p>1. Attend public auction of this property, in tax foreclosure (Tax Sale # 1402) on December 4, 2017, money in hand, prepared to bid up to $2,000 if necessary for the lot purchase.  </p>
<p>2. Regardless of sales outcome (if we have to pay up to 2k or if the lot gets deeded for $230.40 in fees), we will arrange for utility connection and have water and power installed on site as our first order of business.  </p>
<p>3. We will purchase materials for the fence and volunteer farmers will construct a picket fence across the front of the property with a gateway pergola, connecting to chain link fencinig down both sides of the property (about 40% of which is already there and we will simply complete the chain link along both property lines to join at the front picket fence.  </p>
<p>4. We will install security flood lighting over the entryway, at midpoint on a large oak tree on the west side of the property, and a third in the very back, on an existing power pole.  </p>
<p>5. If funding permits, we will install a 'doorbell' 3 camera system that is motion activated.  .</p>
<p>6. We will continue gardening, canning, and building membership for our neighborhood associations using this garden as an organizing tool.   </p>
