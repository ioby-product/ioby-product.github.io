16:T605,<p>My relationship with the Tenderloin runs as deep as the day my grandparents made the Tenderloin their home when arriving in the U.S. from El Salvador, Peru, Japan and the Philippines in the 1970’s. I was born and raised in the Mission and Tenderloin districts. I experienced what these communities looked and felt like, vibrant and welcoming. I felt safe in these streets. I saw beautiful people from all walks of life. I witnessed generosity, and open-hearted kindness in passing. Through the years, I experienced the Tenderloin slowly change and become largely gentrified, with many community members stripped of homes, resources and dignity. The Tenderloin doesn't have much accurate representation today. Many, who may have abilities and resources to help, choose to turn a blind eye on the Tenderloin and don't see the importance of learning the stories of TL community members and think they can't help. This project will make stories of the Tenderloin’s most vulnerable members (youth and elders) seen and heard to help dispel negative views often held about the Tenderloin Community, inspiring positive change to increase empathy and compassion towards the Tenderloin. This docuseries will reach people in and beyond the Bay Area communities and will create a ripple effect for people to help each other by being patient, kind and respectful to the Tenderloin. This project can inspire advocacy and legislation change to benefit the Tenderloin Community supporting underserved residents and improving their livelihood. </p>
