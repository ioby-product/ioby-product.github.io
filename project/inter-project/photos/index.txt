	<strong>We are </strong><span>an unconventional urban landscape design outreach project taking place in Miami Gardens, FL in 2016.</span></h2>
<p><strong><span>What does Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T. mean?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>"Inter-" = inter-generational, inter-cultural, inter-disciplinary, and inter-active.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>"P.R.O.J.E.C.T." = Public space Redevelopment Operation Joining Elders, Community leaders, and Teens.</span></strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T</strong> is a community-based urban landscape design outreach project coordinated by the<strong> <u>Inter-City Arts Collaboratory</u></strong> - a contemporary cultural arts initiative based in Miami and comprised of a network of professional landscape designers, artists, social workers, educators, and community residents (of all ages).</p>
<p>Our<strong> Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T.</strong> <u>team leaders</u> are a group of urban landscape designers from Studio Roberto Rovira in Miami and film makers from Dan Perez Films. </p>
<p>Our Inter-<strong>P.R.O.J.E.C.T</strong>.<u>partners</u> are The Miami Foundation, the City of Miami Gardens, the Miami-Dade County Community Action and Human Services Department,  Florida Memorial University, Florida International University, Harvard Graduate School of Education - Family Dinner Project, Focus Learning Academy, the Institute of Black Family Life, Clarendon Services, and Love Fellowship Ministries.</p>
<p>Our Inter-<strong>P.R.O.J.E.C.T</strong>. <u>team members</u> include senior citizens, teachers, teens, college students, and community leaders who all live, study, or work in the Bunche Park neighborhood of Miami Gardens, Florida.</p>
<p><span>During the spring of 2016, this eclectic and multi-talented group of individuals will join forces ONE afternoon a week to collaborate in multi-faceted community design and discussion workshops in Miami Gardens.</span></p>
<p><span>Our community design and discussion workshops are structured to enable our team members to develop solid relationships with one another, have thought provoking conversations and, of course, research and design a plan to redevelop an under-used public space on the grounds of the <strong>Miami Gardens Community Resource Center located at 16405 NW 25th Avenue in Miami Gardens, FL.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We LOVE that the<strong> Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T.</strong>  is transforming a public space into a sort of  urban test kitchen </span>where we can experiment and try out new recipes for revitalizing and empowering community!  In this test kitchen we are discovering that urban landscape design can be used to not just to redevelop and revitalize a public space, but it can be used  to redevelop and revitalize ourselves and our sometimes outdated ways of thinking!</p>
<p><span>An exciting aspect of the <strong>Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T</strong>. is that we are capturing our entire  (often unpredictable) creative journey </span>on video, in photos, and in narrative content which will be shared and showcased on social media, in a short documentary film, and in various art exhibitions and performance pieces once our project has been completed.</p>
<p> </p>
18:T5f7,<p>Residents of the Bunche Park community in Miami Gardens have repeatedly complained about wanting to see their historic neighborhood in northwestern Miami-Dade County become a more “developed”, more "safe", and a more 'livable' area.</p>
<p>A huge part of increasing the livability index of this community would be to redevelop a large underutilized parking lot on the grounds of the local community resource center and transform this space into a welcoming area for everyone (of all ages) to enjoy - not just be a place to park a car or wait for a bus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the past, residents of Miami Gardens have been apprehensive about the idea of working with urban designers to re-develop their neighborhood because, all too often, redesigning communities to make them more “livable” meant displacing current, often long-term, residents - thereby creating a sense of resentment and antagonism between neighborhood residents and the artists/designers that came in to “revitalize” the neighborhood.</p>
<p>We want to prove that artists and community members  CAN successfully collaborate with one another and CAN create something that is actually relevant to the unique needs of that community and CAN improve the lives of community residents.</p>
<p>Our vision for the Inter-P.R.O.J.E.C.T.  is not just to enhance an urban public space, but  demonstrate how healthier communities really can be cultivated through cultural arts, thought-provoking conversations, and community collaborations.</p>
