17:T4e1,<p>Mar Vista Chamber’s <strong><em>Make It Mar Vista: Small Business Saturday Event</em></strong> is taking place Saturday, November 28, 2015. We envision inviting people from our community and beyond to interact with local businesses, local artists and each other for a day of true community engagement along our Great Street of Venice Boulevard.</p>
<p>We'll work with many partner organizations to make this event a reality, including LA Bike Coalition, Vineyard Christian Fellowship, Green Communications Initiative, City Councilman Mike Bonin's Office, A Kid's Place Preschool, and Grand View Elementary School.</p>
<p>We have many amazing events planned for activating the Great Street for Make it Mar Vista, inlcuding a Kickoff Bike Parade, a Pop-Up Protected Bike Lane with Sustainable Planter Boxes, a Mar Vista Passport game, a Paint-by-Numbers Community Mural, Wayfinding Signs to encourage walking, Sidewalk Directions and Activities, the Story Corps Mar Vista Living History Project, the Artify Mar Vista Interactive Art Projects, and Live Entertainment at the Main Event Hub.</p>
<p>We enthusiastically look forward to engaging the community through the <strong>Make It Mar Vista: Small Business Saturday Event!</strong></p>
