16:T838,<p><span>For over eight years, Founder Maurice “Maui” Goodbeer has devoted himself to a promise he made at his little brother Melvyn’s funeral. A 16 year old gang member in San Diego, CA murdered Melvyn when he was 21 years old. As Maui gave a touching eulogy at his brother's funeral, he shared with his closest family, friends and community members that he would devote his life to providing outreach to inner city youth in hopes to gives them an opportunity to consciously choose a positive lifestyle. As he mourned the loss of his brother, he also meditated on the circumstances of the young man who murdered his brother. He has since immersed himself in understanding the challenges of inner city youth, the school-to-prison cycle, the business of private incarceration that preys on minority youth, and the rapid increase of unjust imprisonment of disadvantaged youth throughout our country. Maui has become a leader and activist in our community lending a voice of inspiration and a bridge to support youth at risk of repeating the vicious cycle of crime and poverty that inner cities can produce. Maui has been inspired to write to the young man who murdered his younger brother, who is currently serving time in prison for first-degree murder, about StreetWaves. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Since creating StreetWaves in 2010, Maui and our amazing team of volunteers have provided a free surf program to at-risk youth through partnering with juvenile detention centers, foster care agencies, inner-city schools and other local youth organizations. </span><span>StreetWaves knows that positive mentorship is key to fostering accountability and responsibility amongst inner city youth. By offering opportunities to children to experience a healthy lifestyle of physical activity, a heightened sense of environmental awareness, and access to community immersion, a renewed sense of awareness, inclusion and wellbeing carries them through an invisible barrier that inevitably suppresses youth in the inner cities. StreetWaves believes the sea can set you free!</span></p>

<p>We are currently fundraising to acquire a <b>SURF CARGO VAN</b> to safely and efficiently transport our surfboards and gear to our meetup points along South Florida. We have an <b>AWESOME NEW PARTNERSHIP </b>with a local youth organization, which means there will be a lot of new children experiencing our empowering ocean mentorship program this summer. We need <b>EXTRA SUPPORT</b> to help us serve them better!</p>
<p>Over a year ago, StreetWaves’ old rusty surf van was towed and fined for appearing to be a “non-working vehicle” and unfortunately a lot of our best surfboards were stolen in the process as well. Since then, <u>we have relied on personal vehicles from our team and volunteers to transport up to 20 boards, our beach tent and all our other surf camp equipment each time we meet up at our various beach locations to surf</u>.<b> NOT HAVING OUR OWN RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION FOR OUR EQUIPMENT SEVERELY LIMITS OUR SERVICES. </b></p>
<p>We are asking for <b>DONATIONS</b> to help us reach our fundraising goal before Summer Camp begins. We also ask that you <b>SHARE OUR CAMPAIGN </b>on social media and with your network of amazing friends and family. <i>Mahalo!</i></p>

	<strong>STREETWAVES MISSION: </strong><em>StreetWaves empowers under-resourced youth through educational marine based programming that teaches surfing, standup paddleboarding, sailing, environmental awareness and ocean safety. This enriching and sustainable program gets youth off the streets and involved in waves of opportunity. The majesty of the sea and the mastery of the ocean cultivate essential life-skills and supports the development of character, courage, and self-esteem while integrating student participants with an expanded diverse community.</em></div>

	<em><b>COMMUNITY CHALLENGE:  </b>The ocean is our playground here in South Florida and water sports have long had a healing effect on the mind, body and soul. Yet a majority of children from lower income neighborhoods near the beach are not exposed to the inspiring abundance that the sea has to offer because these activities often feel out of reach or are not financially possible.</em> For many African American and Latino children, there is also the influence of a long-standing cultural stigma and fear related to swimming. <em> Statistics from the CDC and National Swimming Foundation show that Seventy percent of African-American and sixty percent of Hispanic/Latino children cannot swim. </em></div>
<div>
	<em><strong>OUR OUTCOMES:  </strong>Students learn important new skills, work through fears or insecurities, commit to reaching their goal, and immediately flourish as they feel pride, confidence and triumph as they learn the life-saving ability to swim and also stand up on their board to catch a wave. Ocean water sports take focus, strength and commitment. The art of surfing cultivates strength within as they develop their personal aptitude for positive decision-making skills towards their life path. This successful program draws youth to a sustainable and healthy resource that offers beneficial personal growth, improved physical and emotional wellbeing, an increased awareness of their natural environment and most importantly, water safety skills. StreetWaves will continue to proudly serve disadvantaged and at-risk youth in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County and thanks you in advance for your support!</em></div>
