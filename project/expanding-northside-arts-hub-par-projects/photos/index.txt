17:T1392,<p>As we exit the first few waves of COVID-19, we're excited that our organization has stabilized and that we're able to continue with our expansion plans. These are truly exciting times, so we'd like to first thank you for joining us!<br />
.<br />
As you can see by the campaign tracker below, the support we're hoping to gain from our neighbors is just a portion of a much larger campaign. And as noted by the purple and green areas, <strong>we've already raised over $150,000</strong> and have secured AN EXTREMELY GENEROUS, $150,000 challenge grant from The Haile Foundation, waiting to kick in when we reach the $300,000 mark!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br />
 </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>- - - IMPORTANT (3/1/2023) UPDATE: - - -</strong></p>

<p><br />
Along the way, we ran into a bit of a speed bump with the project's permitting process, so we held back on pushing the community portion of this campaign until we could navigate the unexpected challenges. That said, we continued to fundraise independently of IOBY, but still want to let our IOBY supporters know that we surpassed our $300,000 goal in late 2022. With that, we've been awarded our $150,000 match grant from The Carol Ann and Ralph V. Haile Jr. Foundation and are excited to reintroduce this project to the community in the coming months! </p>

<p>As we begin preparing for our relaunch we want to take a moment to thank all of our IOBY supporters — as well as team IOBY — for the generosity you've shown. With this online piece of the campaign — specifically the COVID Contingency Funds — we've been able to safely and securely build-up capital to help with the campaign relaunch. Specifically, we are looking to hire a campaign manager to help navigate any additional &amp; unexpected turns. So if you've already supported this campaign, please look forward to our contact once we have our new plans back in place.</p>

<p><br />
Also and finally, we do plan to keep our communities updated via the website below, so please don't be a stranger!</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://parprojects.com/MovingForward/" target="_blank">https://parprojects.com/MovingForward/</a></li>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Thanks again</strong><br />

<p><br />

<p> </p>

<p>The orange section above is where you and IOBY come in! We're on a mission to raise $100,000 of support from members and appreciators of the Northside community. To help with the heavy lifting, we're also collecting pledges and raising matching funds to help support this campaign. So if you're interested in sponsoring a smaller challenge grant to inspire your neighbors, please just let us know. We'd love to give you a shoutout and/or put your name on wall.</p>

<p><strong>What's the hype about?</strong></p>

<p>Located along Hoffner Street — a stone's throw from <a href="https://www.gulowstreet.com/" target="_blank">Gulow Street</a> and a skip and a hop from Happen's Garden — we're doing something big. Over three quarters of an acre BIG! ... After over two years of design &amp; redesign, in March of 2021 all six of our zoning variances were approved and we were given the green light to create our outdoor movie theater &amp; performance space at <strong>PAR-Projects</strong>. And in July of 2021, we closed on the purchase of 15,000 square feet of EXPANSION space, <strong>Studeō PAR-</strong> ...a creative space created to welcome and support like-minded creative organizations!</p>

<p>Slowly and steadily, year after year, we've been building up to this point. So even if you're unable to contribute to the project or join us for a tour, we do wonder if you'll take a few minutes to <a href="http://bit.ly/par2021" target="_blank">flip through our campaign brochure</a>. Still, we're seeking support to help US keep this community-building project moving forward. So please do read on.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>A few more details?</strong></p>

<p>Within the walls of each of our gallery spaces, one of our primary goals is to provide deep-seated support for ambitious and underrepresented artists. And if you've been to any of our exhibitions over the years, you've more than likely seen this first hand. We also take every chance we can to help our surrounding community to shine, creatively. The latter is what's driving this project.</p>

<p>Our campus addresses desires of both artists and the community by aligning with <strong>a few areas of need</strong> identified by our neighbors, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A venue for outdoor movies and performances</li>
	<li>A place to learn various art forms from more than one organization</li>
	<li>A family friendly location for events &amp; activations</li>
	<li>More outdoor community gathering spaces</li>
	<li>Flexible and affordable studio spaces</li>
	<li>Space for likeminded nonprofits<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
18:T41a,<p>We believe in being a part of the community where we are located. Our director lives here, in Northside, as do members from our board. And as we contiune growing with the community, we will continue to identify place where we can offer our support, much like we do by organizing events like <a href="http://www.northsidesummermarket.com" target="_blank">Northside Summer Market</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we've successfully navigated our zoning challenges, it's time to start focussing our efforts on creating a centralized arts hub -- one that caters to our community, yet helps establish our community as a regional arts destination.</p>

<p><strong>Our first order of business is to create Northside's FIRST outdoor movie theater!  </strong></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>"Thanks again!" goes out to ArtsWave, Greater Cincinnati Foundation, The Haile Foundation, and the many many others who have helped us get this far. Without your financial and strategic support, we would be nowhere near where we are today!<br />
