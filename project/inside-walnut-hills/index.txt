18:Tbd4,<p>Walnut Hills Redevelopment Foundation (WHRF) is a non-profit community development organization committed to improving the quality of life for residents in Walnut Hills. For the past eight years we have been focused on our vision to create a neighborhood that is vibrant, safe, healthy, and inclusive for all.</p>

<p>Our residents have asked for a lively retail district with cafes, breweries, restaurants, a grocery, green spaces, and hair salons surrounded by diverse housing options. We now have a clear path to achieve this vision. Our latest success is the acquisition of 3.5 acres in the heart of our business district at Peebles Corner. </p>

<p>At this site, we aspire to build new housing, preserve affordable housing, construct an equitable local food system, and create a vibrant, sustainable public space that is welcoming to all. We are initiating community input sessions to add clarity and detail to these goals. An innovative plan and detailed execution of this capstone development is critical to the long-term success of the Walnut Hills Business District.</p>

<p>In the video series, Inside Walnut Hills, you can see that these results don’t happen overnight. Inside Walnut Hills gives a behind-the-scenes look at our passionate entrepreneurs, business district revitalization, arts and culture, and food access efforts. This amazing ecosystem has been made possible by hard work from WHRF, alongside our residents and partners. We need your support to continue that momentum in all aspects of our work!</p>

<p>Our work includes:</p>

<p>Affordable Housing</p>

<ul>
	<li>Supporting residents at the Alexandra to preserve over 80 units of affordable housing</li>
	<li>Creating over 150 units of new affordable housing, including The Scholar House (for single parents enrolled in education), The Manse (for seniors), and Lincoln Gilbert (for families)</li>
	<li>Creating over 30 workforce units, incorporated into Paramount Square and Poste developments</li>
	<li>Supporting residents at the Alms Apartments in their victory to preserve affordable housing for over 100 families</li>
</ul>

</ul>
19:T654,<p>The Walnut Hills Redevelopment Foundation has been around for almost 40 years. We were created by the community council in 1977 to develop quality affordable housing in a time when places like Walnut Hills were being abandoned and, in many cases, forgotten.</p>

<p>After decades of assorted success, the organization was at a crossroads eight years ago. We could close our doors or innovate into an organization that reimagines our role as much more. Having chosen the latter, we maintained that we didn’t just want to be a developer. We wanted to be a catalyst for sustainable and positive change. For the last eight years, WHRF has been working to enhance the quality of life in Walnut Hills.</p>

<p>Our Vision is a Walnut Hills that is vibrant, safe, healthy, and inclusive for all. We believe a quality place should be accessible to everyone. We have a relentless desire for equitable change and growth, for community development that values the community organizing and boots on the ground strategy of the past and matches it with the modern day approaches to big, bold and innovative ideas that are driving urban expansion across the country. Through our work we seek to respect and celebrate the history and identity of Walnut Hills, while inviting new stakeholders to the table to contribute to our community’s growth.</p>

<p>We need your help to continue the momentum we’ve built over the past eight years. We need your help to continue and EXPAND our programs to serve more residents. Our real estate, economic development, and community building activities affect ALL of our residents.</p>
