<p>Currently, Clinton Hill Fort Greene distributes about $6,000 per week in funds to reimburse volunteers purchasing groceries for neighbors. This allows for over 80 weekly deliveries of food, medicine, and baby supplies. We aim to raise four months worth of funds to continue supporting each other. Our goal is to raise $95,900 for the Grocery Fund.</p>

<p>Contributions to the community fridge will cover the cost of infrastructure, cleaning supplies, and transportation costs. Included in our budget is a goal is to raise $2,000 for our Community Fridge project. </p>

18:Tbac,<p><strong>Clinton Hill Fort Greene Mutual Aid (CHFGMA)</strong> is a coalition of neighbors organizing to support each other. Recognizing that our community has been impacted by gentrification and systemic racism, we seek to address harm and create equity through redistribution and advocacy. </p>

<p>We came together in March 2020 when the COVID-19 lockdown began. We created a phone hotline [(862)277-0747], a <a href="https://www.chfgma.org">website</a>, a <a href="https://chfgmutualaid.slack.com">Slack</a> workspace, and a community <a href="https://notion.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a2f7efb31fe0c09ee5856bacb&amp;id=9db6a5352a">newsletter</a>. Since then, we’ve organized a network of thousands of neighbors, to share what we have and fulfill what we need. </p>

<p>Needs for food and other basic necessities for neighbors isolated at home has been the most urgent and highly communicated ask from day one. We’ve found that in the majority of cases, neighbors requesting supplies are struggling financially - meaning they cannot cover the costs of essentials like food, medicine, body care items, baby supplies, cleaning supplies, and PPE.<br />
<br />
We established our <strong>Groceries &amp; Essentials Fund</strong> to help cover the costs of these items for neighbors who cannot afford them at this time. Since March 2020, we have responded to requests from over <strong>1,383 </strong>households in the area, redistributing over <strong>$700,000 </strong>through thousands of shopping trips. Neighbors who reach out over email, social media, phone, or through our online form can choose between two options: we can provide money for them to shop independently, or we can connect them with someone in our network who will shop on their behalf. </p>

<p>Providing groceries and essentials is just one important part of the work we do - we are active in our neighborhoods in many ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mobilizing over 60 volunteers weekly to support local food pantries in partnership with <a href="https://www.onecommunitynyc.org/">OneCommunity</a>, which has become an important bulwark of food security.</li>
	<li>Attending meetings with other local organizations, non-profit leaders, and businesses to stay up-to-date and to make sure we're amplifying each other's efforts.</li>
	<li>Sourcing and delivering laptops, tablets, phones, beds, furniture, and other household goods to neighbors.</li>
	<li>Making wellness calls to isolating neighbors (so far we’ve had <strong>844</strong> conversations with <strong>378</strong> neighbors, in <strong>5</strong> languages).<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways to get involved. If you’d like to learn more, please visit<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chfgma-org/home"> our website</a> and  follow us on <a href="https://instagram.com/chfgaid">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chfgaid/">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
19:T622,<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social justice crisis highlighted the existing deep structural problems that prevent our government from properly caring for its citizens.</p>

<p>We believe, more than ever before, society is in need of mutual aid -  a voluntary exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions, rather than having to depend on the government to take action.</p>

<p>These projects are volunteer-based, with people engaging because they want to effect immediate change. CHFGMA is rooted in solidarity, putting human needs above all - collectively meeting our own needs rather than relying on the institutions that have failed us. By contrast, charity often involves people and organizations choosing who is and is not worthy of support.</p>

<p> As a result of living in a profoundly unequal society, CHFGMA maintains that having needs is not a personal failure. We all have needs, and we all have ways to contribute. We do our best to support each and every person who reaches out to us, regardless of their reasons. We seek to engage our neighbors as a means of honoring existing communities, building new partnerships, and redistributing resources.</p>

<p>While the initial formation of CHFGMA was a result of COVID-19, our work to further solidarity, justice, and equity will go on as long as we are able to continue serving one another.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>
1a:T661,<p>We&rsquo;re looking for neighbors to help CHFGMA in the following areas. If you&rsquo;re interested or want more details, give us a holler at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hello@chfgma.org" target="_blank">hello@chfgma.org</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Newsletter Team:</strong>&nbsp;Calling writers, editors, and designers to help us shape the newsletter that you&rsquo;re reading, which reaches 900+ people each week! We compile the newsletter on Mondays and Tuesdays.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media Crew:&nbsp;</strong>We&rsquo;re looking for more people to help run our Instagram and Facebook accounts to bring in new viewpoints, content, and interests.</li>
	<li><strong>Community-Kindling:&nbsp;</strong>We&rsquo;d love to organize more in-person meetups - Fort&nbsp;Greene&nbsp;Park is a great place for picnics! &nbsp;Give us a holler if you&rsquo;d be interested in organizing get-togethers.</li>
	<li><strong>Neighborhood Organization Outreach:</strong>&nbsp;Connect with local organizations such as churches, community centers, and BIPOC-led efforts. Come join our new&nbsp;channel on Slack!</li>
	<li><strong>Fundraising: </strong>Some of our wonderful members have put together a few fundraisers. We&#39;re now looking for a volunteer (or two, or three) who can take the lead in creating a long-term fundraising strategy and oversee its execution to keep our finances steady for the foreseeable future. Those in this role will collaborate with other members, but otherwise will work fairly autonomously The estimated time commitment for this role is 4 hours per week, with flexibility.<br />
