17:Ta43,<p>Thank you for your interest in <strong>Hands-On Health</strong>! We are a registered 501 (C)(3) nonprofit with the mission to strengthen and educate communites to live at their highest potential through health education. <strong>Hands-On Health</strong> fulfills our mission through two programs, Health Science Labs and The Wealthy Heart Program. The Health Science Labs are provided in schools to promote health education and careers in STEM to under-represented students. The Wealthy Heart Program provides themed heart health screenings to adults. Your donation will fuel <strong>Hands-On Health</strong>'s Wealthy Heart Program with the theme "Burgers and Blood Pressures".  "Burgers and Blood Pressures" serves a heart healthy burger meal as an example of a healthier alternative to a beef burger meal in exchange for health screenings. </p>

<p>In addition, we are all aware that the mask mandate has been lifted but there are still members of our communities that are at a higher risk of complications of COVID-19 during this phase of the pandemic. These risks are due to a lack of COVID-19 and vaccine education, vaccine hesitancy and pre-exisiting health conditions that residents may or may not be aware of to name a few. Our goal is to Double Team COVID-19 &amp; Heart Disease  under the <strong>Wealthy Heart Program</strong> by <strong>Hands-On Health. </strong>This program  is led by a team of diverse medical professionals that will provide residents of Cuyahoga County with education and resources surrounding COVID-19, vaccine hesitancy, up to date safety precautions and awareness of pre-existing heart health conditions that could worsen complications of COVID-19 such as high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>

<p>With the alarming fact that every 37 seconds someone dies of heart disease in the United States and Cleveland holds the eighth spot, this is a great opportunity to double team both COVID-19 and heart disease at the same time!</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a safe space and platform to educate, provide resources and address concerns surrounding COVID- 19, the vaccines and contributing risk factors that exacerbates complications of COVID-19. This mobile health service meets residents where they are mentally and physically in a drive thru setting at local food pantries and churches to provide COVID-19 education, complimentary blood sugar and blood pressure screenings. We will also provide PPE, follow up check-in calls and facilitate connections to local health centers for the COVID -19 vaccine and continuous primary care when necessary.</p>

<p> </p>
18:T40e,<p>May 24, 2021- Meet with current partners to set dates for future 2021 Wealthy Heart programs under Hands-On Health</p>
