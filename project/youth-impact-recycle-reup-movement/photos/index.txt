		<span><span>Community Impact the social enterprise presents Youth Impact Recycle, the ReUp Movement. Recycling for the purpose of Youth workforce development, arts and education. STEM driven with the focus of elevating NorthEast Cleveland to a higher standard of health and sustainable living through which we build, develop and evolve the community. Our aim is to inspire, enable and empower the youth to use their critical thinking abilities to build and create. Taking The Lead To Run The Future!</span></span></h4>
	<h4>
		<span><span>    The youth need more in depth opportunities that will leverage their school curriculum with first hand experience in sustainable business and engineering  (STEM). So that’s what we’re doing, providing youth with quality information pertaining to sustainable business in order to create, develop and manifest a new generation of profound engineers and entrepreneurs. By doing so the youth will be able to showcase their independence and critical thinking abilities in a positive light. The youth are our future, to invest in them is to invest in yourself!</span></span></h4>

	 In 2014 a total of 13% of (msw) municipal solid waste was recycled leaving 87% to be sent landfills. Just by producing plastic with recycled plastic 66% of energy can be saved along with two thousand gallons of gas used from transportation cost to create new plastic. Every year Americans use approximately 2.5 millions bottles in which most are thrown away. Now opposed to these recyclables being trashed let’s utilize them to glorify the youth within sustainable skills and business that will revitalize the community and inspire a higher qaulity of living. </h4>
<h4>
	 With the technical knowledge and resources to be prosperous in business and life, imagine what our youth will accomplish here. Help us propell the youth to advance past the social ills caused by today's failing economy and education system. Youth Impact Recycle will provide job training and resources to the youth to activate their minds in order to build&amp;create business while propelling them forward to reach their full potential!</h4>

<p><span><u>How to grow Youth Impact Recycle:</u><b> In any business you must grow and expand in order to survive. This is precisely why we will initially be training 14 Youth Impact Agents on the information and statistics in regards to how a recycling company operates analytically. Now that the technical information is understood, we show our Agents how to identify the market, what demographic regions are best, and the proper verbiage in order to gain accounts that will produce consistent revenue for job creation, education and art </b><b>programming</b><b>. So in retrospect as their skills grow their position will grow, seeing that they have shown to be proficient in their current position, leading them to be better business men and women ultimately preparing them for a administrative position.</b></span></p>
<br />
<h4>
	<span><span><span><u>Reason of program:</u><span> </span>Community Impact is based in East Cleveland where the population is 95% aboriginal. The city of East Cleveland has gradually taken a social and financial plummet over the last 10 years and vitally needs economic development, which seemingly lacks the the resources to produce consistent revenue to rebuild itself. To add the masses of the youth in the city lack the resources to build, develop and create business to correct these social and economic defaults. Nevertheless Our Youth Impact Recycle program is certainly the most sustainable solution that will enhance the Youth’s abilities in preparation of profound success, yet produce the funds needed to advance them further while demonstrating a functional community unit working diligently to complete a common objective of economic independence and sustainable living in every dynamic.</span></span></span></h4>
