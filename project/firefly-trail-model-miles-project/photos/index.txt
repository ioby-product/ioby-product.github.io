17:Ta4a,<p><strong>Thanks to the generosity of more than 300 donors, Firefly Trail Inc., exceeded its Model Miles Project fundraising goal, receiving nearly $62,300 in donations to augment trail segments to be built in Maxeys, Union </strong><strong>Point</strong><strong> and Athens-Clarke County.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Our Board is amazed, humbled, proud and grateful,” said Ivette Bledsoe, fundraising committee chair. “We knew there was a huge amount of support for the trail, but to exceed our extremely ambitious goal shows how much people want a safe, level place for exercise and active transportation in our communities.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>The funds will be used to help the three cities extend, enhance and promote their soon-to-be-built sections of the trail. When completed, the Firefly Trail will extend about 39 miles from downtown Athens to downtown Union Point, following the historic route of the Georgia Railroad Athens Branch through a number of charming Georgia towns, including Winterville, </strong><strong>Crawford</strong><strong> and Woodville in addition to Union Point, Maxeys and Athens. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fireflytrail.com/uploads/2/0/5/9/20595634/firefly_trail_exceeds_model_miles_fundraising_goal.pdf?mc_cid=b6e86de265&amp;mc_eid=e37686844a" target="_blank"><strong>Read more here. </strong></a></p>
<hr />
<p>The Firefly Trail will be a 39-mile multi-purpose trail in Northeast Georgia, following the abandoned corridor of the Georgia Railroad Athens Branch. From the university city of Athens to the friendly towns of Maxeys and Union Point, the trail will promote safety, better health, economic development, transportation options, tourism, historic preservation -- and fun.</p>
<p>Linking urban, suburban and rural landscapes, the trail will be a linear park that enhances the environment and highlights our region's rich history and culture.</p>
<p>Firefly Trail, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) Georgia charity incorporated to spearhead the creation of the trail. We are working closely with three municipalities -- Maxeys, Union Point and Athens -- to create model miles in each city. All three cities are committed to raising substantial funding to make paving the first segments of the trail a reality. However, additional funds are needed for these projects, especially in the small towns of Maxeys and Union Point.</p>
<p>In partnership with our communities, the Firefly Trail Model Miles Project will spur the creation of the full trail by demonstrating its transformational potential to the entire region. Your help is needed and deeply appreciated!</p>
18:T781,<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Many of the towns and all of the rural areas the trail will serve have few, if any, sidewalks, bike facilities or other infrastructure for off-road exercise and active transportation. For example, to walk to their elementary school just north of Union Point, students must use the unimproved shoulder of a busy 2-lane highway. In Athens, three people have tragically lost their lives since 2014 while bicycling on roads close to the route of the Firefly Trail.</p>
<p><strong>Health: </strong>Thousands of people living near the trail corridor are unable to play and exercise safety in their own communities. As a result, most don't. Rates of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are among the highest in the nation. Studies show every $1 spent on trails yields $2.94 in direct health benefits.  Using the trail will not only be safer, it will be fun -- inspiring more people to get up and get moving. The Firefly Trail will bring opportunities and hope for longer, healthier, happier lives.</p>
<p><strong>Economic development:</strong> Many of the neighborhoods and communities served by the Firefly Trail are struggling economically. Trails create opportunities for new and existing businesses; attract new residents, entrepreneurs and tourists; boost property values, and improve quality of life. A Firefly Trail economic impact study estimates the finished trail will attract more than 1.1 million users a year and generate $14.7 million in annual economic impact. Just building the trail will generate/sustain 158 jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Attractive corridor:</strong> The corridor connects charming towns, beautiful countryside, schools, businesses, historic features and town centers. Importantly, as an abandoned railroad corridor, it provides a level route through the hills and valleys of Northeast Georgia, allowing people of all ages and abilities to enjoy using it.</p>
19:T71e,<p>Firefly Trail Inc., has had the wonderful opportunity to watch and assist as these three municipalities work hard to raise the necessary funds to start building the trail in their towns. Your donations to our Model Miles Campaign will expand and enhance these efforts. Firefly Trail Inc., will devote 100% of the proceeds as follows–</p>
<p>1. $25,000 to the town of Maxeys for purchasing paving materials, with the goal of building 1.5 miles of paved trail with unpaved side track inside the city limits. Maxeys has secured $316,000 in city funds, grants, and in-kind donations to fund this project. Paving the Maxeys Model Mile is expected to begin in June of 2017 and be completed by fall 2017.</p>
<p>2. $30,000 to the city of Union Point to augment funding for paving materials and construction costs, with a goal of creating a safe route from downtown to Union Point STEAM Academy, a K-8 public school which presently can be accessed only via a high-speed highway. Union Point has secured $150,000 in local funds and grants. Construction is expected to begin on the Union Point Model Mile in summer 2018.</p>
<p>3. Up to $5,000 to assist the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County in promoting their first mile of the Firefly Trail, currently under construction and scheduled for completion in fall 2017. This segment is entirely funded by local sales tax revenues and federal grants. Our funds will assist the unified government in raising awareness of the new trail segment and building public support to complete the remaining 7 miles of trail in Athens-Clarke County.</p>
<p>4.  In the event this campaign raises more than $60,000, any funds in excess of the goal will be used to provide additional assistance to Maxeys and Union Point for trail-related purposes.</p>
